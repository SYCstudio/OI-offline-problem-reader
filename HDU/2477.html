In this problem, we won’t go through all that puzzles. Which we are interested in is this one -- crop circles.<br><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/C165-1004-1.jpg><br>You have probably seen pictures of crop circles. (i.e. see above) They are circular patterns which mysteriously appear in fields of crop, such as wheat and barley. For research, we model these patterns as N circles in the plane and number them with 1, 2, …, N. Each of them has its center (Xi, Yi), radius Ri and an importance value Vi which is evaluated by the scientists.<br><br>After our observation, we found that there aren’t any two circles touch each other in the crop circles. But it’s possible that a circle is completely within another one. When we are in a certain circle, we should pass through its borderline once in order to get out from it. <br><br>For two distinct circles A and B, if one can go to B from A without passing through more than K borderlines, we say that A and B are connected. Here comes the problem: For all connected cycle pairs (A, B), what’s the maximum difference of the importance value between them? The difference of the importance value between A and B can be defined as |VA – VB|.<br>For example, look at the picture below. For K = 3, the optimal solution is to select the circle 1 and 3 which make the difference of importance value 220. And there are 3 borderlines between circle 1 and 3.<br>|V5 – V1| = 300, which is larger than 220, but circle 5 and circle 1 are not connected. There’re 4 borderlines between them, so we won’t consider these kinds of pairs.<br><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/C165-1004-2.jpg></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line of input gives the number of cases T &lt;= 20.
