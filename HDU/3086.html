Recently, Jiaoshou had cleared “Need for Speed Undercover”. In this game, Jiaoshou acted as a spy. To prove that he is not a spy, Jiaoshou must do some evil things frequently. So lots of police cars often ran after him. In order to escape from the chase, Jiaoshou need to accelerate his Bugatti Veyron. <br> <br>To simplify this problem, we just assume that only one police car ran after Jiaoshou. And Bugatti Veyron’s speed is vx. The police car’s speed is vy. v is a function of first degree or a constant, as the form of a*m+b. In this form, m means the minute that the car has run.<br>Now Jiaoshou is S meters ahead. Jiaoshou like to know if he could escape from the chase. He want you to write a program to solve this problem.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input contains several tests. The first line of the input is a single integer T (T&lt;1000) which is the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.<br>Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains a single real number S (0&lt;S&lt;=10^6) , as the problem has described. The second line contains two real numbers ax, bx, indicating Bugatti Veyron’s speed is ax*m+bx. The last line also contains two real numbers ay, by, indicating the police car’s speed is ay*m+by. All numbers are range from -1000 to 1000, except S.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">If Jiaoshou can escape from the chase, please output “Good driver,Jiaoshou!”. Otherwise, please output the real number M rounded to three digits after the decimal point , in the form of “Oh,God!Jiaoshou will be catched after M minutes.” <br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">2
