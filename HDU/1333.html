Smith had the following peculiar property: The sum of the digits of that number was equal to the sum of the digits of the prime factors of that number. Got it? Smith’s telephone number was 493-7775. This number can be written as the product of its prime factors in the following way: <br><br><center>4937775 = 3 * 5 * 5 * 65837</center><br>The sum of all digits of the telephone number is 4+9+3+7+7+7+5= 42?, and the sum of the digits of its prime factors is equally 3+5+5+6+5+8+3+7= 42. Wilansky was so amazed by his discovery that he named this kind of numbers after his brother-in-law: Smith numbers.<br><br>As this observation is also true for every prime number, Wilansky decided later that a (simple and unsophisticated) prime number is not worth being a Smith number, so he excluded them from the definition.<br><br>Wilansky published an article about Smith numbers in the Two Year College Mathematics Journal and was able to present a whole collection of different Smith numbers: For example, 9985 is a Smith number and so is 6036. However,Wilansky was not able to find a Smith number that was larger than the telephone number of his brother-in-law. It is your task to find Smith numbers that are larger than 4937775!<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input consists of a sequence of positive integers, one integer per line. Each integer will have at most 8 digits. The input is terminated by a line containing the number 0.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For every number n &gt; 0 in the input, you are to compute the smallest Smith number which is larger than n, and print it on a line by itself. You can assume that such a number exists.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">4937774
