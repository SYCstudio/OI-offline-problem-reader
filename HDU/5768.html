On the other hand, ?? abhors some other prime numbers and thinks a number x divided by pi which is one of these prime numbers with a given remainder ai will bring him bad luck.  In this case, many of his lucky numbers are sullied because they can be divisible by 7 and also has a remainder of ai when it is divided by the prime number pi.<br>Now give you a pair of x and y, and N pairs of ai and pi, please find out how many numbers between x and y can bring ?? good luck.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">On the first line there is an integer T(T≤20) representing the number of test cases.<br>Each test case starts with three integers three intergers n, x, y(0&lt;=n&lt;=15,0&lt;x&lt;y&lt;$10^{18}$) on a line where n is the number of pirmes. <br>Following on n lines each contains two integers pi, ai where pi is the pirme and ?? abhors the numbers have a remainder of ai when they are divided by pi. <br>It is guranteed that all the pi are distinct and pi!=7. <br>It is also guaranteed that p1*p2*…*pn&lt;=$10^{18}$ and 0&lt;ai&lt;pi&lt;=$10^{5}$for every i∈(1…n).<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, first output &quot;Case #x: &quot;,x=1,2,3...., then output the correct answer on a line.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">2
