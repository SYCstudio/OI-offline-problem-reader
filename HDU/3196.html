With only ONE ship at the beginning of his career, he had to carefully consider the trip to maximize his incoming. But unlike other vehicles, shipping costs much more time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, Nineright comes to you for your help. He is so excited, and said:” help me! I have found the best way to do the business. I would consider the route as a circle that my ship could run every minute! What’s more, I find the route with the maximum average profit is the best. Now, I am going to get them together…”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;What a nice idea! You’re going to help him, don’t you! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;You are going to get the map as a directed graph. And from city i to city j, you would earn some money p<sub>ij</sub> by do the business. It will cost you t<sub>ij</sub> time to finish that. You are going to find the circle route with maximum average profit! </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are no more than 20 cases. Process to the end of file<br>Each case begin with N (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 100) represents the number of the city.<br>Following are N line each with N numbers. The j-th number of the i-th rows stands for the profit you will get if you ship from city i to cit j. with the same format the next N*N number give the time to finish that trip. p<sub>ij</sub> would be a integer that lies between -1000 and 10000 and The profit p<sub>ij</sub> doesn’t have to be same with p<sub>ji</sub>, because cities have different demands. This is also holds for t<sub>ij</sub> and t<sub>ji</sub> maybe because the weather. t<sub>ij</sub> would also be an integer lies between 1 and 1000.
