A pupil stops after the question is answered correctly. Each pupil is allowed up to five attempts to answer the question correctly. Pupils who answer correctly on the first attempt are marked present. Pupils who answer correctly after more than one attempt are encouraged to work at home. Pupils who fail to develop a correct answer within five attempts are given remedial classes after school. Pupils who do not give any answer are marked as abscent. Your task is to write a program that reads the pupils' assessments and generates performance reports for the principal to proceed with appropriate actions.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input starts with an integer K (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 100) indicating the number of classes.
