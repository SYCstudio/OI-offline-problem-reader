Now the head of the village decided to make a road through the village and it must be straight, for a straight line makes the way shortest and meanwhile, saves the cost. At that time, the heads of the two families proposed, because they didn’t want their own families live separated along the two sides of the road, thus it might decrease the solidarity of family. Besides, the two families were antipathetic to each other; neither wanted to live together with the other in a same side of the road. Then it made the village head in a pickle, he hoped the road to be as wide as possible. So what’s the possible maximal width of this road?<br>In order to simplify the problem, let’s regard the living place of each family member is just a point.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are several test cases in the input.<br><br>The first line of each input contains n and m (1 ≤ m,n ≤ 1000).
