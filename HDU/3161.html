After all, you already know the optimal solution. To entertain yourself, you find another puzzle game called &quot;Pipes&quot;, and play that for a while. On one puzzle, you have not been able to find a solution by hand, and you think that there is no solution. You decide to write a program to tell you whether this is the case.<br><br>The game is played on a grid with <i>R</i> rows and <i>C</i> columns. Each square of the grid contains a black dot in the centre and black lines in the direction of some, none, or all of its north, east, south, and west neighbouring squares, with the following restriction: if two opposite directions both have lines, then at least one of the other two directions has a line as well. In other words, it is forbidden for a square to consist of a straight line.<br><br>The objective of the game is to rotate each square, as many times as you like, such that for each square, if it has a line going in a compass direction (that is, north, east, south, or west), then it has a neighbour in that compass direction and that neighbour has a line going in the opposite compass direction. In other words, each edge in the grid should either have a line on both sides or neither side.<br><br>Your task is to determine whether a given grid has a solution.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input consists of several test cases. <br><br>The first line of each test case contains the two integers <i>R</i> and <i>C</i>, separated by spaces, with 1 &lt;= <i>R</i>,<i>C</i> &lt;= 12. <br><br>The following <i>R</i> lines of input each contain one row of the grid, from north to south. Each of these lines contains exactly <i>C</i> strings of letters, separated by spaces, that correspond to squares of the grid, from west to east. Their format is as follows:<br><ul><li>If the string is the single character <b><i>x</i></b>, then the square does not contain a line to any of its neighbours. </li><br><li>Otherwise, the string contains some of the characters N, E, S, W, which indicate that a black line extends from this square's centre in the direction of its north, east, south, or west neighbour, respectively. No character will appear in the string more than once.</li></ul>Input is terminated by a line containing 0 0. These zeros are not a test case and should not be processed.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, output SOLVABLE if there is a solution to the puzzle, and UNSOLVABLE otherwise.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">3 3
