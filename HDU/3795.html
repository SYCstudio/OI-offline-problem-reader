It is typically used to show the changes between a file and a former version of the same file. Diff displays the changes made per line for text files.<br>The operation of diff is based on solving the longest common subsequence problem which is as follows: Given two sequences A = a1, a2, ..., aM, and B = b1, b2, ..., bN, find the length, k, of the longest sequence C = c1, c2, ..., ck such that C is a subsequence of both A and B. As an example, if<br>A = d, y, n, a, m, i, c and B = p, r, o, g, r, a, m, m, i, n, g<br>then the longest common subsequence is a, m, i( {3,4,5} from A, {5,6,8} from B) and has length 3.<br>You may find {5,7,8} from B is also a, m, i, but {5,6,8} is lexicographic smaller, so we choose the former one. We always choose the lexicographic smallest one.<br>From the longest common subsequence it's only a small step to get diff-like output:<br>dyn-progr+m+c-ng+<br>where '-' means a deletion from and '+' means an addition to the first string.<br>Now you are supposed to simulate the diff operation.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Your program must read test cases from standard input.<br>The input file consists of several test cases. Each case contains the contents of two files. The case starts with two non-negative integers N and M (both &lt;= 50), then followed by N+M lines, each contains a string of no more than 80 characters. The first N lines are the contents of the first file, while the second M lines are of the second file.<br>The input is finished by a negative N.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, your program must output to standard output. If there is no difference found between the two files, print in a line &quot;No difference found&quot;. If there is nothing in common between the two files, print in a line &quot;Totally different&quot;. Otherwise, first print in a line the length of the longest sequence. Then for each line of the first file, print the line number, and output the differences in the diff-like format line by line, as shown by the sample output.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1 1
