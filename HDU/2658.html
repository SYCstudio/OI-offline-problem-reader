This world lives some birds which are recognized as firebirds. Actually, the firebirds' world exists three kind of birds, respectively created by GL, WYB, CTW. So I will call them &quot;Gbird&quot;, &quot;Wbird&quot;, &quot;Cbird&quot; below.<br>What's more, these birds can talk to ACMers and have their own habit as follows:<br>Gbird are like GL, never tell truth. Wbird like to tell the truth in the day, but lie in the night. While Cbird are all honest, and never lie.<br>Now, some firebirds talk to you and tell you some statements, can you deduce what kind of these birds are, and whether it's day or night?<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input contains several cases. Each description starts with two integer n and m respectively represent the number of birds and statements. Then following m lines each contain one statement. And one statement is begin with &quot;X: &quot;, X is the identity of speaker. Then follows the contents, like following kinds: <br><br>I am [not] ( Gbird | Wbird | Cbird | lying ).<br>X is [not] ( Gbird | Wbird | Cbird | lying ).<br>It is ( day | night ). <br><br>The word in [] may appear or not appear. The word in () mean that exactly one of the words separated by | must appear. X is the identity of birds, it's a uppecase character between 'A' and 'Z'. <br>0 &lt; n &lt; 27, 0 &lt; m &lt; 100, 'A' &lt;= X &lt;= 'Z'.<br>Input end with a case n = 0 and m = 0.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each case, first output a line with &quot;Case #x:&quot;, x represent the number of case and start with 1. Then print &quot;You're kidding.&quot;, if the conversation cannot happen according to the rules or &quot;I messed up.&quot;, if no facts can be deduced. Otherwise print all the facts that can be deduced.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1 1

case 1: You cannot reduce anything from it.
case 2: If A is lying, then it's telling a truth. If it's telling a truth, it's lying. So it cannot happen according to the rules.
case 3: Gbird won't say itself is a Gbird, so C is lying(statement 4 is false). You can reduce that it is night and C is a Wbird.
 So B is telling the truth(statement 2 is true). 
It's a Cbird. A is not a Wbird(statement 3 is false) and is not a Cbird(statement 1 is false). So A is a Wbird.</div><i style='font-size:1px'> </i></div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">数据范围与提示</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"> <a href="/search.php?field=problem&key=%BE%F6%D5%BD%C1%FA%BB%A2%C3%C5&source=1&searchmode=source"> 决战龙虎门 </a> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ui vertical footer segment"><div class="ui center aligned container"><span style="color: #999;">OI-offline-problem-reader Powered by <a href="http://www.sycstudio.com">SYCstudio</a>.</span></div></div></div></body></html>
