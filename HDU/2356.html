This was the first time that Rome had been taken by foreign troops in eight hundred years.<br><br>You will simulate a considerably less bloody (and less realistic) rout of soldiers by a potentially overwhelming force.<br><br>Consider a group of invaders of strength I, and an opposing force of strength J, with distance D between them and a defensive stronghold of strength<br>S. The Routing Force F of the invaders can be calculated as their strength times the distance:<br><br>F = ID<br><br>and the Blocking Force B of the defenders can be calculated as their strength times the square of their defenses:<br><br>B = JS<sup>2</sup><br><br>If F is less than or equal to B, the invaders' rout fails, and they are driven off. If F is greater than B, the rout is successful, all defenders of the<br>stronghold are driven off, and the invaders can continue. However, their strength is reduced by removing a fraction equal to the ratio of the<br>defenders' Blocking Force to their Routing Force for that attack. The resulting number should be rounded up to the nearest integer, to ensure that a<br>successful rout leaves at least one soldier:<br><br>I<sub>new</sub> = ?I(1 -  B/F)?<br><br>If the invaders make it through a stronghold, its location is considered the starting point for calculations regarding the next group of defenders, and so<br>on, until either the invading force makes it all the way through the defenders or is completely routed.<br><br>Your goal is to determine whether or not a given invading force can make it through a particular gauntlet of defenders.<br><br>For the purposes of simplification, all defending strongholds in this simulation are considered to be in a straight line from the starting position of the<br>invaders, and must be encountered in order from nearest to furthest away. No strongholds will be in the same location in a given set of data.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set consists of<br>the following components:<br><br>A line containing a single integer E (1 ≤ E ≤ 20) indicating the number of defensive strongholds in the data set;<br>A series of E lines, each with three integers D, J, S (1 ≤ D, J ≤ 10000; 1 ≤ S ≤ 50) separated by spaces representing the strongholds. D is the<br>distance of the stronghold from the invaders' starting position; remember that all strongholds are considered to be in a straight line from<br>the invaders' starting position, and must be encountered in order from nearest to furthest away. J and S represent the strength of the<br>defenders and the stronghold, respectively, as in the above equation; and<br>A line containing a single integer I (1 ≤ I ≤ 30000) representing the strength of the invading force.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each data set, print &quot;ROUT!&quot; if the invaders make it through all of the strongholds, or &quot;RETREAT!&quot; if the invaders cannot make it through all of the<br>strongholds.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">2
