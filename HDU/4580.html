A gun men are hunting him. Guy can't keep running all the time . At night ,he has to find a place to sleep, and that's very dangerous. In the sky, there are many flying rocks, Guy decides to stay on those rocks at night. The good thing is that the gun man is stupid, he always fire toward a fixed direction. And Guy knows the direction. Guy wants to find a place on a certain rock so that the rock can protect him best from the bullets. The more distance a bullet has to travel inside the rock to reach Guy, the safer is Guy. Please find the safest place for Guy. <br>Guy's world is a 2D plane. A rock can be consider as a polygon. Guy can just stay on the edge of the rock, he can't get inside a rock. Guy stands on a rock ,but he can't hang on a rock. As shown below, Guy can stay on point B,C and D, but he can't stay on point A,E,F and G because if he stay there, he will fall down to the ground when he get asleep.<br><br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/C474-1005-1.jpg></center> <br><br>The direction of the gun fire can be described as a vector (d<sub>x</sub>, d<sub>y</sub>). The gun man is infinite far away, and he can choose any infinite far away point as the firing position. In other words, the bullet may fly along any straight line which is parallel to the vector (d<sub>x</sub>,d<sub>y</sub>). </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">First Line is an integer T &lt;=20, means the number of test cases.<br>In each test cases, the first line is one integer m describing the number of polygons.<br>Then m polygons follow.

<div style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:14px;background-color:F4FBFF;border:#B7CBFF 1px dashed;padding:6px'><div style='font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#7CA9ED;border-bottom:#B7CBFF 1px dashed'><i>Hint</i></div>
In the first sample input, Guy could only stand on two segments: {(-1,1)-(0,1)}, and{(0,0)-(1,0)}
Notice that, Guy cannot stand on (-1,1),(0,1) and (1,0).

<center><img src='./data/images/C474-1005-2.jpg'></center> 

For the firing direction dx = 0, dy = 1, we could see that the safest place is any point on segment (-1,1) - (0,1) (except two ends). And a bullet has two travel distance 2 inside the rock to hit Guy. 
Please do pay attention to the test case 2 and 3.
