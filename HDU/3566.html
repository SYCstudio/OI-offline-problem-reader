Now the qualifier is feverishly on show. Those who pass the qualifier will have the chance to advance to the final, and may win the Super King of Counting Heads! The qualifier has two rounds, and N players will participate in it. The scores for player i in Round 1 and Round 2 are xi and yi respectively. The host will select one of a player's scores as his final result. If a player's score in Round 1(or Round 2) is selected as his final result, he will be involved in the rank of Round 1(or Round 2). The first g players involved in Round 1(and Round 2) will advance to the final. Two Rounds rank scores separately from high to low. If less than g players are involved in the rank of Round 1(or Round 2), all of them advance.<br><br>Every country hopes his players can win the title, especially the host country. How can the host select the scores so as to maximize the number of native final players according to the rules? <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line is an integer T (T &lt;= 200), representing the number of test cases.<br><br>In each test case, two integers N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 200), g (0 &lt;= g &lt;= N / 2) come in the first line.
