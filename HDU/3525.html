In order to make the venue more harmonious visual effect，to choose two sequence (A[c[1]],A[c[2]],......A[c[len]]) (B[d[1]],B[d[2]],.....B[d[len]]),A[c[i]]=B[d[i]] (1=i&lt;=len) The teacher want to know the max len,can you help us?Namely, you should find the max len such that there exists two identical subsequence with len elements in A and B respectively(these two subsequence need not to be continuous).<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line of input should give the number of cases, T (at most 20).the first line of each case has two numbers n,m(1&lt;=n&lt;=10000,1&lt;=m&lt;=10)n represent the number of players，numbers from 1 to n ，m  represent the number of mm of each player`s cheering squad，The next two lines，each with  n*m*2  numbers，the i*2-1 number means the ith mm`s supported player number v[i]（1&lt;=v[i]&lt;=n）,the i*2 number means the  ith  mm`s faviourite positionw[i](1&lt;=w[i]&lt;=m*n), we set the mm number i is earlier than the mm number j when (i&lt;j).</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each case, output should be one line containing &quot;Case #x: &quot;,then flollow a number ,the max len. </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1
