They keep a habit of running everyday, especially the Head King, because he isn't confident about his figure (please don't tell him~).<br><br>The Head King is going to build a new city, which contains $N$ towns. He want to build some bidirectional roads between some of the towns (each road connect two towns) and choose some of them to form his private running route. The Head King <b>can't accept more than one bidirectional roads between two towns</b>, because he has no sense of direction and it will make him bemused. He prefers enjoying the landscape changing while running, so he <b>can't stand any same road on his running route</b>. <br><br>Now, the Head King wants to know the total number of scheme of road constructing. Every scheme satisfies that there exist a town for him both to start and finish running(the running route contains at least one road). Please note the <b>towns in the city needn't to be connected to each other</b>.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">First line contains $T(T \leq 10)$, the number of test cases.<br><br>For each case, there is one single line containing one non-negative integer $N(n \leq 2e5)$.<br><br>It is guarantee that there are at most one case in which $n \geq 1000$<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, output a single number —— the number of schemes modulo the population of King's country($1004535809$).</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">3

In sample 1, the Head King can't design any scheme. 
In sample 2, the Head King can build three roads:1-2, 2-3, 3-1, and he can start from town 1 (2 and 3 are also legal) and run along the route:1-2-3-1 (or 1-3-2-1).
In sample 3, one possible scheme is building 3 roads:1-3, 3-4, 4-1, and the Head King can start from town 3 and run along the route:3-1-4-3.
