He soon became IGM, the  best title of Codefires. Besides, he is famous for his coding speed and the achievement in the field of Data Structures.<br>   After become IGM, Memset137 has a new goal: He wants his score in CF rounds to be as large as possible.<br>   What is score? In Codefires, every problem has 2 attributes, let's call them Ki and Bi(Ki, Bi＞0). if Memset137 solves the  problem at Ti-th second, he gained Bi-Ki*Ti score. It's guaranteed Bi-Ki*Ti is always positive during the round time.<br>   Now that Memset137 can solve every problem, in this problem, Bi is of no concern. Please write a program to calculate the  minimal score he will lose.(that is, the sum of Ki*Ti).<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">   The first line contains an integer N(1≤N≤10^5), the number of problem in the round.<br>   The second line contains N integers Ei(1≤Ei≤10^4), the time(second) to solve the i-th problem.<br>   The last line contains N integers Ki(1≤Ki≤10^4), as was described.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">   One integer L, the minimal score he will lose.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">3
