If at the i-th second, a condition is given to the monitor, then the monitor will give an alert at the j-th second reporting that the condition given at the i-th second is met. Here j is the minimum integer such that the numbers generated by the generator from the i-th second to the j-th second and in range [ $l_i, r_i$ ] equals to $c_i$ . Otherwise, the generator will generate a number $a_i$ . However, the monitor stops working now. We need you to write a program to give the alerts.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.<br>For each test case, the first line contains an integer m and n. The following n lines describe events. The i-th line describe the event happens at the i-th second. If the event is to give a condition, then it contains a character ”C” followed by $l_i , r_i$ and $c_i$ . Otherwise, the event is to generate a number and it contains a character ”G” followed by $b_i$ . $a_i$ , the number generated at the i-th second equals to the XOR sum of bi and the moments of all conditions met before i-th second.<br>It is guaranteed that 1 ≤ m ≤ $10^4$ and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × $10^5$ .</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, the output starts with a line ”Case #i:” where i is the test case number, starting from 1.

At the 1st second, a condition is given. We need to make an alert when 1 number in range [1, 3] are generated.
At the 2nd second, a condition is given. We need to make an alert when 2 number in range [3, 5] are generated.
At the 3rd second, a number is generated. It is 4 because no condition is met before. We don’t need to make any alert because no condition is met after 4 is generated.
At the 4th second, a number is generated. It is 1 because no condition is met before. We need to make an alert because condition at 1st second is met after 1 is generated.
At the 5th second, a number is generated. Because condition at the 1st second is met before, the actual number generated should be 3 xor 1 which is 2. We don’t need to make any alert because no condition is met after 2 is generated.
At the 6th second, a number is generated. Because condition at the 1st second is met before, the actual number generated should be 2 xor 1 which is 3. We need to make an alert because condition at the 2nd second is met after 3 is generated.
