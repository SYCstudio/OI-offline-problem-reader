So, every girl can choose a boy first, with whom she has not quarreled, to make up a family. Besides, the girl X can also choose boy Z to be her boyfriend when her friend, girl Y has not quarreled with him. Furthermore, the friendship is mutual, which means a and c are friends provided that a and b are friends and b and c are friend. <br>Once every girl finds their boyfriends they will start a new round of this game—marriage match.
