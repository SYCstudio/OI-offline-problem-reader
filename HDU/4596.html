However, the Maya will not play a joke any more and the Rapture finally comes in. Fortunately people have already found out habitable planets, and made enough airships to convey all the human beings in the world. A large amount of airships are flying away the earth. People all bear to watch as this planet on which they have lived for millions of years. Nonetheless, scientists are worrying about anther problem…<br>As we know that long distance space travels are realized through the wormholes, which are given birth by the distortion of the energy fields in space. Airships will be driven into the wormholes to reach the other side of the universe by the suction devices placed in advance. Each wormhole has its configured attract parameters, X, Y or Z. When the value of ID%X is in [Y,Z], this spaceship will be sucked into the wormhole by the huge attraction. However, the spaceship would be tear into piece if its ID meets the attract parameters of two wormholes or more at the same time. <br>All the parameters are carefully adjusted initially, but some conservative, who treat the Rapture as a grain of truth and who are reluctant to abandon the treasure, combine with some evil scientists and disrupt the parameters. As a consequence, before the spaceships fly into gravity range, we should know whether the great tragedy would happen or not. Now the mission is on you.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Multiple test cases, ends with EOF.<br>In each case, the first line contains an integer N(N&lt;=1000), which means the number of the wormholes. <br>Then comes N lines, each line contains three integers X,Y,Z(0&lt;=Y&lt;=Z&lt;X&lt;2*10<sup>9</sup>).</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">If there exists danger, output “Cannot Take off”, else output “Can Take off”.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">2
