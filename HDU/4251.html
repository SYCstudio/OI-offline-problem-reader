When they decided to take training, Mr. B would choose one of them from the problem set. All the problems in the problem set had been sorted by their time of publish. Each time Prof. S, their coach, would tell them to choose one problem published within a particular time interval. That is to say, if problems had been sorted in a line, each time they would choose one of them from a specified segment of the line.<br><br>Moreover, when collecting the problems, Mr. B had also known an estimation of each problem’s difficultness. When he was asked to choose a problem, if he chose the easiest one, Mr. G would complain that “Hey, what a trivial problem!”; if he chose the hardest one, Mr. M would grumble that it took too much time to finish it. To address this dilemma, Mr. B decided to take the one with the medium difficulty. Therefore, he needed a way to know the median number in the given interval of the sequence.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100,000) indicating the total number of problems. The second line contains n integers xi (0 &lt;= xi &lt;= 1,000,000,000), separated by single space, denoting the difficultness of each problem, already sorted by publish time. The next line contains a single integer m (1 &lt;= m &lt;= 100,000), specifying number of queries. Then m lines follow, each line contains a pair of integers, A and B (1 &lt;= A &lt;= B &lt;= n), denoting that Mr. B needed to choose a problem between positions A and B (inclusively, positions are counted from 1). It is guaranteed that the number of items between A and B is odd.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each query, output a single line containing an integer that denotes the difficultness of the problem that Mr. B should choose.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">5
