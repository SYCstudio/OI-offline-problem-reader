They will hang a banana at the roof of a building, and at the mean time, provide the monkey with some blocks. If the monkey is clever enough, it shall be able to reach the banana by placing one block on the top another to build a tower and climb up to get its favorite food.<br><br>The researchers have n types of blocks, and an unlimited supply of blocks of each type. Each type-i block was a rectangular solid with linear dimensions (xi, yi, zi). A block could be reoriented so that any two of its three dimensions determined the dimensions of the base and the other dimension was the height. <br><br>They want to make sure that the tallest tower possible by stacking blocks can reach the roof. The problem is that, in building a tower, one block could only be placed on top of another block as long as the two base dimensions of the upper block were both strictly smaller than the corresponding base dimensions of the lower block because there has to be some space for the monkey to step on. This meant, for example, that blocks oriented to have equal-sized bases couldn't be stacked. <br><br>Your job is to write a program that determines the height of the tallest tower the monkey can build with a given set of blocks.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input file will contain one or more test cases.
