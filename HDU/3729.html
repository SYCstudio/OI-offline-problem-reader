There are n students in the class. The students didn’t want to tell their teacher their exact score; they only told their teacher their rank in the province (in the form of intervals).<br><br>After asking all the students, the teacher found that some students didn’t tell the truth. For example, Student1 said he was between 5004th and 5005th, Student2 said he was between 5005th and 5006th, Student3 said he was between 5004th and 5006th, Student4 said he was between 5004th and 5006th, too. This situation is obviously impossible. So at least one told a lie. Because the teacher thinks most of his students are honest, he wants to know how many students told the truth at most.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There is an integer in the first line, represents the number of cases (at most 100 cases).

Please note that there are no spaces at the head or tail of each line. If there are more than one way, output the list with maximum lexicographic. (In the example above, 1 2 3;1 2 4;1 3 4;2 3 4 are all OK, and 2 3 4 with maximum lexicographic)</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">2
