But the game we play here is rather easy. It just contains three suits: stones, bamboos and characters.<br>Stones consist of a number of circles. Each circle is said to represent can (筒, tóng) coins with a square hole in the middle.<br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/3391-1.png></center> <br>Bamboos consist of a number of bamboo sticks. Each stick is said to represent a string (索, suǒ) that holds a hundred coins. Note that 1 Bamboo is an exception: it has a bird sitting on a bamboo, to prevent alteration.<br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/3391-2.png></center> <br>Each character represents ten thousand (萬, wàn) coins.<br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/3391-3.png></center> <br>A player wins the round by creating a standard mahjong hand, which consists of a certain number of melds (namely, four for 13-tile variations) and a pair. A meld is three tiles which are adjacent in one suit or all the same. A pair is two same tiles.<br>Now one player has three tiles in hand. Can you tell what more tile he need to win?<br>Note that the number of each tile in Mahjong is four. So if the number of one tile the player has is four, he cannot get this tile anymore.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line contains one integer T indicating the number of test cases.<br>For each case, there are thirteen tiles in one line, separated by one space.<br>Each tile has two characters.

Hint
In case 3, if the player gets 1s, he can combine them into four melds (1s1s1s, 1s2s3s, 4s5s6s, 7s8s9s) and a pair (9s9s). And so it is with 2s to 9s.
2s: 1s1s1s, 3s4s5s, 6s7s8s, 9s9s9s, 2s2s
3s: 1s2s3s, 3s4s5s, 6s7s8s, 9s9s9s, 1s1s
