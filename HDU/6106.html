In the second test case, the data uploaded by Class 1 is wrong. 
Because we can't find a solution which satisfies the limitation. 
As for Class 2, we can calculate the number of students who only enrolled in course A is 2, 
the number of students who only enrolled in course B is 6, and nobody enrolled in course C,
the number of students who only enrolled in courses A and B is 1, 
the number of students who only enrolled in courses B and C is 3, 
the number of students who only enrolled in courses A and C is 1, 
the number of students who enrolled in all courses  is 2, 
so the total number in Class 2 is 2 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 15.
