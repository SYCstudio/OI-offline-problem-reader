This game has been one of the world's most popular game in recent years. The world of Minecraft is made up of lots of $1 \times 1 \times 1$ blocks in a 3D map. Blocks are the basic units of structure in Minecraft, there are many types of blocks. A block can either be a clay, dirt, water, wood, air, ... or even a building material such as brick or concrete in this game.<br><br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/C646-1012-1.jpg></center><br><center><b>Figure 1: A typical world in Minecraft.</b></center><br><br>Nyanko-san is one of the diehard fans of the game, what he loves most is to build monumental houses in the world of the game. One day, he found a flat ground in some place. Yes, a super flat ground without any roughness, it's really a lovely place to build houses on it. Nyanko-san decided to build on a $n \times m$ big flat ground, so he drew a blueprint of his house, and found some building materials to build.<br><br>While everything seems goes smoothly, something wrong happened. Nyanko-san found out he had forgotten to prepare glass elements, which is a important element to decorate his house. Now Nyanko-san gives you his blueprint of house and asking for your help. Your job is quite easy, collecting a sufficient number of the glass unit for building his house. But first, you have to calculate how many units of glass should be collected.<br><br>There are $n$ rows and $m$ columns on the ground, an intersection of a row and a column is a $1 \times 1$ square,and a square is a valid place for players to put blocks on. And to simplify this problem, Nynako-san's blueprint can be represented as an integer array $c_{i,j} (1\le i \le n, 1 \le j \le m)$. Which $c_{i,j}$ indicates the height of his house on the square of $i$-th row and $j$-th column. The number of glass unit that you need to collect is equal to the surface area of Nyanko-san's house(exclude the face adjacent to the ground).</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line contains an integer $T$ indicating the total number of test cases.<br>First line of each test case is a line with two integers $n,m$.<br>The $n$ lines that follow describe the array of Nyanko-san's blueprint, the $i$-th of these lines has $m$ integers $c_{i,1}, c_{i,2}, ..., c_{i,m}$, separated by a single space.<br><br>$1 \le T \le 50$<br>$1 \le n,m \le 50$<br>$0 \le c_{i,j} \le 1000$</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, please output the number of glass units you need to collect to meet Nyanko-san's requirement in one line.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">2
