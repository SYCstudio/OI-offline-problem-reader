Then, for each round, each player shows a hand by choosing 5 cards from the cards he gets, and two players compare the hands they showed. The player who shows a better kind of hand wins the game. If they show the same kind of hands, they discard the cards they have shown and proceed to the next round. There are at most 5 rounds in a game. If they show the same kind of hands in all of the 5 rounds, the game ends in a tie.<br>Both players play optimally. Your task is to find out the winner and the kind of hands he shows.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line is the number of test cases up to 600.<br>For each test case, there are two lines.
