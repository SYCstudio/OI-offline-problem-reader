Expensive Drink</h1></div><div class="row" style="margin-top: -15px"><span class="ui label">内存限制：10000/5000 MS (Java/Others)</span> <span class="ui label">时间限制：65536/65536 K (Java/Others)</span></div></div></br><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">题目描述</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are some water, milk and wine in your kitchen. Your naughty little sister made some strange drinks by mixing them together, and then adds some sugar! She wants to know whether they taste good, but she doesn't want to try them herself. She needs your help.<br><br>Your sister knows that you don't want to drink them either (anyone wants to?), so she gives you a chance to escape: if you can guess the price of a special drink, she gives you freedom. Warning: she loves her special drink so much that you should never under-estimate its cost! That is, you're to find the most expensive possible price of it.<br><br>The price of each drink equals to its cost. If the amounts of water, milk, wine and sugar used in the drink are a1, a2, a3 and a4 respectively, and the unit costs of water, milk, wine and sugar are c1, c2, c3 and c4 respectively, then the drink costs a1c1 + a2c2 + a3c3 + a4c4 . To give you some hope to win, she told you the costs of exactly n ordinary drinks. Furthermore, she promised that the total cost of sugar a4c4 is always a real number in the interval [L, R] , in any drink.<br><br>Sadly, you don't know the exact price of anything (you're a programmer, not a housewife!), but you know that water is the cheapest; wine is the most expensive, i.e., 0&lt;=c1&lt;=c2&lt;=c3 . Then the best thing you can do is to assume units costs can be any real numbers satisfying this inequality.<br><br>Write a program to find the highest possible price of the special drink. </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains three positive integers n, L, R  (1&lt;=n&lt;=100, 0&lt;=L&lt;=R&lt;=100) . The next n  lines each contain four non-negative integer a1, a2, a3 , p  (0&lt;=a1,a2,a3&lt;=100, 0&lt;=p&lt;=10000) , the amount of water, milk and wine, and the price. The last line of the case contains three integers a1, a2, a3  (0&lt;=a1,a2,a3&lt;=100) , the drink to be estimated.
