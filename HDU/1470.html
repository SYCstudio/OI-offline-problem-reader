Every inhabitant recognizes the type of every other inhabitant. <br>A social scientist wants to visit the island. Because he is not able to distinguish the three kinds of beings only from their looks, he asks you to provide a communication analyzer that deduces facts from conversations among inhabitants. The interesting facts are whether it is day or night and what kind of beings the speakers are. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input contains several descriptions of conversations. Each description starts with an integer n, the number of statements in the conversation. The following n lines each contain one statement by an inhabitant. Every statement line begins with the speaker's name, one of the capital letters A, B, C, D, E, followed by a colon `:'. Next is one of the following kinds of statements: <br><br>I am [not] ( divine | human | evil | lying ). <br><br>X is [not] ( divine | human | evil | lying ). <br><br>It is ( day | night ). <br><br>Square brackets [] mean that the word in the brackets may or may not appear, round brackets () mean that exactly one of the alternatives separated by | must appear. X stands for some name from A, B, C, D, E. There will be no two consecutive spaces in any statement line, and at most 50 statements in a conversation. <br><br>The input is terminated by a test case starting with n = 0. <br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each conversation, first output the number of the conversation in the format shown in the sample output. Then print &quot;This is impossible.'', if the conversation cannot happen according to the rules or &quot;No facts are deducible.'', if no facts can be deduced. Otherwise print all the facts that can be deduced. Deduced facts should be printed using the following formats: <br><br>X is ( divine | human | evil ). <br><br>It is ( day | night ). <br><br>X is to be replaced by a capital letter speaker name. Facts about inhabitants must be given first (in alphabetical order), then it may be stated whether it is day or night. <br><br>The output for each conversation must be followed by a single blank line. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1

No facts are deducible.

Conversation #2
This is impossible.

Conversation #3
A is human.
It is night.

Conversation #4
A is evil.
B is divine.


Reasoning made easy 

To make things clearer, we will show the reasoning behind the third input example, where A says ``I am evil.''.
 What can be deduced from this? 
Obviously A cannot be divine, since she would be lying, similarly A cannot be evil, since she would tell the truth. 
Therefore, A must be human, moreover, since she is lying, it must be night. So the correct output is as shown. 

In the fourth input example, it is obvious that A is lying since her two statements are contradictory. 
So, B can be neither human nor evil, and consequently must be divine. B always tells the truth, thus A must be evil. Voil‘a! </div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">数据范围与提示</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"> <a href="/search.php?field=problem&key=ACM%CA%EE%C6%DA%BC%AF%D1%B5%B6%D3%C1%B7%CF%B0%C8%FC%A3%A8%BE%C5%A3%A9&source=1&searchmode=source"> ACM暑期集训队练习赛（九） </a> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ui vertical footer segment"><div class="ui center aligned container"><span style="color: #999;">OI-offline-problem-reader Powered by <a href="http://www.sycstudio.com">SYCstudio</a>.</span></div></div></div></body></html>
