Harmony Forever</h1></div><div class="row" style="margin-top: -15px"><span class="ui label">内存限制：20000/10000 MS (Java/Others)</span> <span class="ui label">时间限制：32768/32768 K (Java/Others)</span></div></div></br><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">题目描述</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">We believe that every inhabitant of this universe eventually will find a way to live together in harmony and peace; that trust, patience, kindness and loyalty will exist between every living being of this earth; people will find a way to appreciate and cooperate with each other instead of continuous bickering, arguing and fighting. Harmony -- the stage of society so many people dream of and yet it seems so far away from now ...<br><br>Fortunately, the method of unlocking the key to true Harmony is just discovered by a group of philosophers. It is recorded on a strange meteorite which has just hit the earth. You need to decipher the true meaning behind those seemingly random symbols ... More precisely, you are to write a program which will support the following two kinds of operation on an initially empty set S :<br><br>1.<br>    B X : Add number X to set S . The Kth command in the form of B X always happens at time K , and number X does not belong to set S before this operation. <br>2.<br>    A Y : Of all the numbers in set S currently, find the one which has the minimum remainder when divided by Y . In case a tie occurs, you should choose the one which appeared latest in the input. Report the time when this element is inserted. <br><br>It is said that if the answer can be given in the minimum possible time, true Harmony can be achieved by human races. You task is to write a program to help us. </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each test case starts with one integer T  where 1&lt;=T&lt;=40000 . The following T  lines each describe an operation, either in the form of ``B X &quot; or ``A Y &quot; where 1&lt;=X , Y&lt;=500000 .<br><br>T = 0 indicates the end of input file and should not be processed by your program. </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Print the result of each test case in the format as indicated in the sample output. For every line in the form of ``A Y &quot;, you should output one number, the requested number, on a new line; output -1 if no such number can be found. Separate the results of two successive inputs with one single blank line.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">5
