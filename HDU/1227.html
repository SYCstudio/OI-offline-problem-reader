Recently, they have decided to build several depots along the highway, each one located at a restaurant and supplying several of the restaurants with the needed ingredients. Naturally, these depots should be placed so that the average distance between a restaurant and its assigned depot is minimized. You are to write a program that computes the optimal positions and assignments of the depots. <br><br>To make this more precise, the management of McBurger has issued the following specification: You will be given the positions of n restaurants along the highway as n integers d1 &lt; d2 &lt; ... &lt; dn (these are the distances measured from the company's headquarter, which happens to be at the same highway). Furthermore, a number k (k &lt;= n) will be given, the number of depots to be built. <br><br>The k depots will be built at the locations of k different restaurants. Each restaurant will be assigned to the closest depot, from which it will then receive its supplies. To minimize shipping costs, the total distance sum, defined as<br><br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/1227-1.gif></center><br><br>must be as small as possible.<br><br>Write a program that computes the positions of the k depots, such that the total distance sum is minimized. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input file contains several descriptions of fastfood chains. Each description starts with a line containing the two integers n and k. n and k will satisfy 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 200, 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 30, k &lt;= n. Following this will n lines containing one integer each, giving the positions di of the restaurants, ordered increasingly.<br><br>The input file will end with a case starting with n = k = 0. This case should not be processed. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each chain, first output the number of the chain.
