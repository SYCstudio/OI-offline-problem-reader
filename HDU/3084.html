Then following N lines give the description of the projects. Each line contains four non-negative integers M (0 &lt; M ≤ 8), S, E (0 &lt; S, E ≤ T) and P. With the same meaning described above. <br><br>The next line contains a single integer Q (0 ≤ Q &lt; 2^8), denotes Q descriptions of cooperation as following.<br>Each description is a single line, the first integer q shows the number of employees in this cooperation. Then the following q integers mean those q employees’ id (0 ≤ id &lt; 8) and the last integer means the extra profits F.
