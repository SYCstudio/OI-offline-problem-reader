For a long period, he went to office with the shortest path because he loves to sleep late…Time goes by, he find that he should have some changes as you could see, always riding with the same path is boring.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, oooccc1 got an idea! Why could I take another path? Tired at all the tasks he got, he got no time to carry it out. As a best friend of his, you’re going to help him!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since oooccc1 is now getting up earlier, he is glad to take those paths, which are a little longer than the shortest one. To be precisely, you are going to find all the second shortest paths.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;You would be given a directed graph G, together with the start point S which stands for oooccc’1 his house and target point E presents his office. And there is no cycle in the graph. Your task is to tell him how long are these paths and how many there are.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are some cases.
