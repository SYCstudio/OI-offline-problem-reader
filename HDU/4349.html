Maybe he thinks it is the best way to show he is alone without a girl friend. The day 2011.11.11 comes. Seeing classmates walking with their girl friends, he coundn't help running into his classroom, and then opened his maths book preparing to count odd numbers. He looked at his book, then he found a question &quot;C<sub>(n,0)</sub>+C<sub>(n,1)</sub>+C<sub>(n,2)</sub>+...+C<sub>(n,n)</sub>=?&quot;. Of course, Xiao Ming knew the answer, but he didn't care about that , What he wanted to know was that how many odd numbers there were? Then he began to count odd numbers. When n is equal to 1, C<sub>(1,0)</sub>=C<sub>(1,1)</sub>=1, there are 2 odd numbers. When n is equal to 2, C<sub>(2,0)</sub>=C<sub>(2,2)</sub>=1, there are 2 odd numbers...... Suddenly, he found a girl was watching him counting odd numbers. In order to show his gifts on maths, he wrote several big numbers what n would be equal to, but he found it was impossible to finished his tasks, then he sent a piece of information to you, and wanted you a excellent programmer to help him, he really didn't want to let her down. Can you help him?</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Each line contains a integer n(1&lt;=n&lt;=10<sup>8</sup>)</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">A single line with the number of odd numbers of C<sub>(n,0)</sub>,C<sub>(n,1)</sub>,C<sub>(n,2)</sub>...C<sub>(n,n)</sub>.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1
