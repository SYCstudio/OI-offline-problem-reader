Evensgn was curious about this series of books.So he took a look at them. He found out there was a story about &quot;Little E&amp;Little Q&quot;. While losing himself in the story,he disrupted the order of the books.<br><br>Knowing that dxy would be back soon,Evensgn needed to get the books ordered again.But because the books were too heavy.The only thing Evensgn could do was to take out a book from the book stack and and put it at the stack top. <br><br>Give you the order of the disordered books.Could you calculate the minimum steps Evensgn would use to reorder the books? If you could solve the problem for him,he will give you a signed book &quot;The Stories of SDOI 9: The Story of Little E&quot; as a gift.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are several testcases.<br><br>There is an positive integer $T(T\leq 30)$ in the first line standing for the number of testcases.<br><br>For each testcase, there is an positive integer $n$ in the first line standing for the number of books in this series.<br><br>Followed $n$ positive integers separated by space standing for the order of the disordered books,the $ith$ integer stands for the $ith$ book's number(from top to bottom).<br><br><br><b>Hint:</b><br>For the first testcase:Moving in the order of $book3,book2,book1$ ,$(4,1,2,3)\rightarrow (3,4,1,2)\rightarrow(2,3,4,1)\rightarrow(1,2,3,4)$,and this is the best way to reorder the books.<br>For the second testcase:It's already ordered so there is no operation needed.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each testcase,output one line for an integer standing for the minimum steps Evensgn would use to reorder the books.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">2
