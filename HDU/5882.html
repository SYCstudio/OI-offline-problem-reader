These shapes are &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;paper&quot;, and &quot;scissors&quot;. The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors (&quot;rock crushes scissors&quot;) but will lose to one who has played paper (&quot;paper covers rock&quot;); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (&quot;scissors cut paper&quot;). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.<br><br>Recently, there is a upgraded edition of this game: rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard, in which there are totally five shapes. The rule is simple: scissors cuts paper; paper covers rock; rock crushes lizard; lizard poisons Spock; Spock smashes scissors; scissors decapitates lizard; lizard eats paper; paper disproves Spock; Spock vaporizes rock; and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.<br><br>Both rock-paper-scissors and rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard are balanced games. Because there does not exist a strategy which is better than another. In other words, if one chooses shapes randomly, the possibility he or she wins is exactly $50\%$ no matter how the other one plays (if there is a tie, repeat this game until someone wins). Given an integer $N$, representing the count of shapes in a game. You need to find out if there exist a rule to make this game balanced.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases. t test cases follow.<br>For each test case, there is only one line with an integer $N~(2\leq N \leq 1000)$, as described above.<br><br>Here is the sample explanation.<br><br>In the first case, donate two shapes as A and B. There are only two kind of rules: A defeats B, or B defeats A. Obviously, in both situation, one shapes is better than another. Consequently, this game is not balanced.<br><br>In the second case, donate two shapes as A, B and C. If A defeats B, B defeats C, and C defeats A, this game is balanced. This is also the same as rock-paper-scissors.<br><br>In the third case, it is easy to set a rule according to that of rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test cases, output &quot;Balanced&quot; if there exist a rule to make the game balanced, otherwise output &quot;Bad&quot;.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">3
