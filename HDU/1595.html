It is possible to come from Marica's city to Mirko's no matter which road is closed.<br>  Marica will travel only by non-blocked roads, and she will travel by shortest route. Mirko wants to know how long will it take for her to get to his city in the worst case, so that he could make sure that his girlfriend is out of town for long enough.Write a program that helps Mirko in finding out what is the longest time in minutes it could take for Marica to come by shortest route by non-blocked roads to his city.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Each case there are two numbers in the first row, N and M, separated by a single space, the number of towns,and the number of roads between the towns. 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ M ≤ N*(N-1)/2.
