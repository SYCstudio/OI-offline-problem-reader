If the card hung any further out, with its center of gravity off the table, it would fall off the table and flutter to the floor. The same reasoning applies if the card were placed on another card, rather than on a table. <br><br>Two playing cards can be arranged, carefully, with short edges parallel to table edges, to extend 3/4 of a card length beyond the edge of the table. The top card hangs half a card length past the edge of the bottom card. The bottom card hangs with only 1/4 of its length past the table's edge. The center of gravity of the two cards combined lies just over the edge of the table. <br><br>Three playing cards can be arranged, with short edges parallel to table edges, and each card touching at most one other card, to extend 11/12 of a card length beyond the edge of the table. The top two cards extend 3/4 of a card length beyond the edge of the bottom card, and the bottom card extends only 1/6 over the table's edge; the center of gravity of the three cards lines over the edges of the table. <br><br>If you keep stacking cards so that the edges are aligned and every card has at most one card above it and one below it, how far out can 4 cards extend over the table's edge? Or 52 cards? Or 1000 cards? Or 99999?<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Input contains several nonnegative integers, one to a line.
