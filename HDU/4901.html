The devil always asks the king to do some crazy things. Although the king used to be wise and beloved by his people. Now he is just like a boy in love and can’t refuse any request from the devil. Also, this devil is looking like a very cute Loli.<br><br>   You may wonder why this country has such an interesting tradition? It has a very long story, but I won't tell you :).<br><br>   Let us continue, the party princess's knight win the algorithm contest. When the devil hears about that, she decided to take some action.<br><br>   But before that, there is another party arose recently, the 'MengMengDa' party, everyone in this party feel everything is 'MengMengDa' and acts like a 'MengMengDa' guy.<br><br>   While they are very pleased about that, it brings many people in this kingdom troubles. So they decided to stop them.<br><br>   Our hero z*p come again, actually he is very good at Algorithm contest, so he invites the leader of the 'MengMengda' party xiaod*o to compete in an algorithm contest.<br><br>   As z*p is both handsome and talkative, he has many girl friends to deal with, on the contest day, he find he has 3 dating to complete and have no time to compete, so he let you to solve the problems for him.<br><br>   And the easiest problem in this contest is like that:<br><br>   There is n number a_1,a_2,...,a_n on the line. You can choose two set S(a_s1,a_s2,..,a_sk) and T(a_t1,a_t2,...,a_tm). Each element in S should be at the left of every element in T.(si &lt; tj for all i,j). S and T shouldn't be empty.<br><br>   And what we want is the bitwise XOR of each element in S is equal to the bitwise AND of each element in T.<br><br>   How many ways are there to choose such two sets? You should output the result modulo 10^9+7.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">   The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases.<br>   For each test case, the first line contains a integers n.<br>   The next line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n which are separated by a single space.<br><br>   <b>n&lt;=10^3, 0 &lt;= a_i &lt;1024, T&lt;=20.</b></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">   For each test case, output the result in one line.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">2
