The indepence is defined that if there exist two roads which are made up of enterprises(Vertexs) and their financial trade relations(Edge) has the common start point S and end point T, and expect S and T, none of other enterprise in two chains is included in these two roads at the same time. So that if one of enterpirse bankrupt in one of road, the other will not be obstructed.<br><br>Now there are N enterprises, and have M pair of financial trade relations between them, the relations are Mutual. They need to ask about Q pairs of enterprises' safety situations. When two enterprises have two or more independent financial chains, we say they are safe enough, you needn't provide exact answers.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The Input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains three integers, N ( 3 &lt;= N &lt;= 5000 ), M ( 0 &lt;= M &lt;= 10000 ) and Q ( 1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 1000 ). which are the number of enterprises, the number of the financial trade relations and the number of queries.<br>The next M lines, each line contains two integers, u, v ( 0 &lt;= u, v &lt; N &amp;&amp; u != v ), which means enterpirse u and enterprise v have trade relations, you can assume that the input will not has parallel edge.<br>The next Q lines, each line contains two integers, u, v ( 0 &lt;= u, v &lt; N &amp;&amp; u != v ), which means entrepreneurs will ask you the financial safety of enterpirse u and enterprise v.<br>The last test case is followed by three zeros on a single line, which means the end of the input.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each case, output the test case number formated as sample output.
