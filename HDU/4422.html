Little girl Alice planned to pick mushrooms in five mountains. She brought five bags with her and used different bags to collect mushrooms from different mountains. Each bag has a capacity of 2012 grams. Alice has finished picking mushrooms in 0 ≤ n ≤ 5 mountains. In the i-th mountain, she picked 0 ≤ w<sub>i</sub> ≤ 2012 grams of mushrooms. Now she is moving forward to the remained mountains. After finishing picking mushrooms in all the five mountains, she want to bring as much mushrooms as possible home to cook a delicious soup.<br>         Alice lives in the forest of magic. At the entry of the forest of magic, live three mischievous fairies, Sunny, Lunar and Star. On Alice's way back home, to enter the forest, she must give them exactly three bags of mushrooms whose total weight must be of integral kilograms. If she cannot do so, she must leave all the five bags and enter the forest with no mushrooms.<br>         Somewhere in the forest of magic near Alice's house, lives a magician, Marisa. Marisa will steal 1 kilogram of mushrooms repeatedly from Alice until she has no more than 1 kilogram mushrooms in total. So when Alice gets home, what's the maximum possible amount of mushrooms Alice has? Remember that our common sense doesn't always hold in Gensokyo. People in Gensokyo believe that 1 kilogram is equal to 1024 grams.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">         There are about 8192 test cases.

In the second sample, if Alice doesn't pick any mushrooms from the 5-th mountain. She can give (512+512+0) =1024 grams of mushrooms to Sunny, Lunar and
Star. Marisa won't steal any mushrooms from her as she has exactly 1 kilogram of mushrooms in total.
In the third sample, there are no three bags whose total weight is of integral kilograms. So Alice must leave all the five bags and enter the forest with no mushrooms.
In the last sample:
1.Giving Sunny, Lunar and Star: (208+308+508)=1024
2.Stolen by Marisa: ((708+1108)-1024)=792
