Some few months ago, XX always sat beside QQ and they always talked about some hard programming problems and also sometimes played StarCraft (∩_∩). XX likes playing Protoss while QQ likes playing Terran, and XX is a perfect player and courage QQ to win the others. But now, XX has gone to ZJU to study master, so QQ always thinks of him. XX is a mischievous boy, and he invariably comes up with lots of hard problems to challenge QQ, but fails at the most time. In the recent days, XX finds a problem which he regards as a very puzzling problem. Being surprised by QQ’s skill, XX is determined to let you solve this problem and tests whether the problem is enough puzzling, the problem is described: <br>It's not hard to see that every triangulation breaks the polygon into n-2 triangles. The triangulation is called k-isosceles, if there are exactly k isosceles triangles among them. Given integer n and k, compute the number of distinct k-isosceles triangulations of a regular polygon with n vertices. Return the result modulo 9397.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">  There are many test cases.<br>   For every case, there are two nonnegative integer n and k, 3&lt;=n&lt;=50, 0&lt;=k&lt;=n-2;<br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For every case, output the result modulo 9397.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">4 2

Hint: 
For the first case, we can have a diagonal between vertices 0 and 2 or between vertices 1 and 3. In both cases, there are 2 isosceles triangles.
For the second case, the only triangulation of an equilateral triangle contains no diagonals and 1 isosceles triangle (the polygon itself).
For the third case, a regular pentagon has 5 triangulations. 
Each of them is obtained by connecting one selected vertex with the two others that are not its neighbors, so each triangulation is 3-isosceles.
