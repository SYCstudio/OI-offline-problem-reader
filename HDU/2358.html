(These coordinates are not used in the problem, but are useful for understanding the<br>underlying adjacencies.)<br><br>The rules of Influence are simple; the pertinent details are as follows:<br><br>Players take turns placing Manipulators on the board. Manipulators occupy a single location, and there may be at most one Manipulator at a<br>location. If there is no empty location on the board to place a piece, the player must pass their turn.<br>Each player has a certain amount of Influence. A player has a single point of Influence for every location on the board that is strictly closer to<br>one of their Manipulators than a Manipulator of any other player. This is not &quot;straight-line&quot; distance, but the number of cells in a minimal path<br>to a Manipulator. On the above grid, the cell F5 is 2 steps away from G6, 1 step away from G5, and 0 steps away from itself.<br>The player with the most Influence at the end of the game wins.<br><br>In the sample input below, the first player (represented by &quot;!&quot; marks) has only two Influence, that provided by the locations that his Manipulators are<br>on; the second player (represented by &quot;@&quot; signs) has ten Influence, and the third player (represented by &quot;#&quot; marks) has four Influence. There are<br>nine locations that provide Influence to no player, as they are equally distant from two or more of the players.<br><br>Given a particular board layout, answer this question: what would the resulting Influence be for each player's optimal move if they were making the<br>last move in the game?<br><br>Moves are to be considered independently; that is, the maximum score for the second player should be calculated based on the original board layout,<br>not the one after the first player's best move.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) indicating the number of data sets. Each data set consists of<br>the following components:<br><br>A line containing a single integer P (2 ≤ P ≤ 4) indicating the number of players in the game;<br>A line containing a single integer D (1 ≤ D ≤ 26) indicating the board's dimension (9 would represent the 9x9 board above); and<br>A series of D lines, each representing a row on the board from top to bottom. Each location on the row is represented by one of the following<br>characters, separated by spaces:<br>. — An empty location;<br>! — A piece for the first player;<br>@ — A piece for the second player;<br># — A piece for the third player (if playing); or<br>$ — A piece for the fourth player (if playing).<br>Note that there may be extra whitespace on these lines (and only these lines).
