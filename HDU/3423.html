There are some stations and roads in the city now, any road has a cost. To save money, you decided not to construct every road, but to make sure that there exist a path between every two stations.<br>Sorry, the mission isn't completed. You know, there are n stations in the city,some contestants visit other stations regularly to admire some so-called big cows. Being naturally averse to spending hours each day on commuting, you should help them to find a place to live for which the total travel time is minimal.<br>Every road has an ID, from 1 to m. If there are multiple approaches leading to the same minimal cost, the mayor prefers the one of which road IDs selected holds the smallest lexicographic order. For instance, rebuilding ID ( 1 3 5) and ID (2 4 5) will both ensure the minimum cost,the mayor will choose the former one.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">First,a number t,indicating the number of the testcases.<br>For every testcase, there is a number n and m,n(1&lt;=n&lt;=50000) indicating the number of cities,whereas m (0&lt;=m&lt;=500000) indicating the number of roads.<br>then m lines follow each lines contains three integers a,b,c.(1&lt;=a,b&lt;=n&amp;&amp;a!=b,1&lt;=c&lt;=10000)which means there is a road from a to b whose cost is c.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">First the minimum cost.If doesn't exist,only output &quot;Poor mayor.&quot;(without quotes)<br>Then output the answer and all the candidate stations.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">3

Hint:
In the first sample we use road 1 and 3 ,the minimus cost is 10+15=25
and we get a new graph 3-1-2,city 1 is the best answer ,2*10+2*15=50
Whereas the third, we can't get city 1,2,3 connected.
In the last, we choose the road 1,the minimus cost is 15
and we get a new graph 1-2,both city 1 and city 2 are the best answer ,2*15=30</div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">数据范围与提示</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"> <a href="/search.php?field=problem&key=HDOJ+Monthly+Contest+%A8C+2010.06.05&source=1&searchmode=source"> HDOJ Monthly Contest – 2010.06.05 </a> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ui vertical footer segment"><div class="ui center aligned container"><span style="color: #999;">OI-offline-problem-reader Powered by <a href="http://www.sycstudio.com">SYCstudio</a>.</span></div></div></div></body></html>
