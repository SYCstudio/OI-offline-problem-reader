To ensure proper processing, the shapes in the picture cannot intersect. However, some logos contain such intersecting shapes. It is necessary to detect them and decide how to change the picture.<br><br>Given a set of geometric shapes, you are to determine all of their intersections. Only outlines are considered, if a shape is completely inside another one, it is not counted as an intersection.<br><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/2327-1.png><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Input contains several pictures. Each picture describes at most 26 shapes, each specified on a separate line. The line begins with an uppercase letter that uniquely identifies the shape inside the corresponding picture. Then there is a kind of the shape and two or more points, everything separated by at least one space. Possible shape kinds are:<br><br>&amp;#8226; square: Followed by two distinct points giving the opposite corners of the square.<br>&amp;#8226; rectangle: Three points are given, there will always be a right angle between the lines connecting the first point with the second and the second with the third.<br>&amp;#8226; line: Specifies a line segment, two distinct end points are given.<br>&amp;#8226; triangle: Three points are given, they are guaranteed not to be co-linear.<br>&amp;#8226; polygon: Followed by an integer number N (3 ≤ N ≤ 20) and N points specifying vertices of the polygon in either clockwise or anti-clockwise order. The polygon will never intersect itself and its sides will have non-zero length.<br><br>All points are always given as two integer coordinates X and Y separated with a comma and enclosed in parentheses. You may assume that |X|, |Y | ≤ 10000.<br><br>The picture description is terminated by a line containing a single dash (“-”). After the last picture, there is a line with one dot (“.”).</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each picture, output one line for each of the shapes, sorted alphabetically by its identifier (X). The line must be one of the following:<br><br>&amp;#8226; “X has no intersections”, if X does not intersect with any other shapes.<br>&amp;#8226; “X intersects with A”, if X intersects with exactly 1 other shape.<br>&amp;#8226; “X intersects with A and B”, if X intersects with exactly 2 other shapes.<br>&amp;#8226; “X intersects with A, B, . . ., and Z”, if X intersects with more than 2 other shapes.<br><br>Please note that there is an additional comma for more than two intersections.
