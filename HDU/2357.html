These files generally have a canonical<br>location, known as the absolute path (such as /usr/games/bin/kobodl), which can be used to refer to the file no matter where the user is on a<br>system.<br><br>Most operating system environments allow you to refer to files in other directories without having to be so explicit about their locations, however.<br>This is often stored in a variable called PATH, and is an ordered list of locations (always absolute paths in this problem) to search for a given name.<br>We will call these search paths.<br><br>In the brand-new crash shell, paths are handled somewhat differently. Users still provide an ordered list of locations that they wish to search for files<br>(their search paths); when a particular filename is requested, however, crash tries to be even more helpful than usual. The process it follows is as<br>follows:<br><br>If there is an exact match for the filename, it is returned. Exact matches in locations earlier in the list are preferred. (There are no duplicate<br>filenames in a single location.)<br>If there are no exact matches, a filename that has a single extra character is returned. That character may be at any point in the filename, but<br>the order of the non-extra characters must be identical to the requested filename. As before, matches in locations earlier in the list are<br>preferred; if there are multiple matches in the highest-ranked location, all such matches in that location are returned.<br>If there are no exact matches or one-extra-character matches, files that have two extra characters are looked for. The same rules of precedence<br>and multiple matches apply as for the one-extra-character case.<br>If no files meet the three criteria above, no filenames are returned. Two characters is considered the limit of &quot;permissiveness&quot; for the crash<br>shell.<br><br>So, for example, given the two files bang and tang, they are both one character away from the filename ang and two from ag. (All characters in this<br>problem will be lowercase.) In the sample data below, both cat and rat are one character away from at.<br><br>Given a complete list of locations and files in those locations on a system, a set of users each with their own ordered lists of search paths, and a set of<br>files that they wish to search for, what filenames would crash return?<br><br>For the purposes of simplification, all locations will be described by a single alphabetic string, as will filenames and usernames. Real operating<br>system paths often have many components separated by characters such as slashes, but this problem does not. Also note that users may accidentally<br>refer to nonexistent locations in their search paths; these (obviously) contain no files.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">All alphabetic strings in the input will have at least one and at most 20 characters, and will contain no special characters such as slashes or spaces; all<br>letters will be lowercase.<br><br>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) indicating the number of data sets.
