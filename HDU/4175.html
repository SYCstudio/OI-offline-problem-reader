The day begins with all the category 1 classes being taught simultaneously. These all end at the same time, and then all the category 2 classes are taught, etc. Fred has to take exactly one class in each category. His goal is to choose the set of classes that will minimize the amount of  &quot;energy'' required to carry out his daily schedule. <br>The energy requirement of a schedule is the sum of the energy requirement of the classes themselves, and energy consumed by moving from one class to the next through the schedule. <br><br>More specifically, taking the jth class in the ith category uses E<sub>ij</sub> units of energy. The rooms where classes take place are located at integer positions (ranging from 0 to L) along a single hallway. The jth class in the ith category is located at position P<sub>ij</sub>. Fred starts the day at position 0, moves from class to class, according to his chosen schedule, and finally exits at location L. Moving a distance d uses d units of energy. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line of the input is Z ≤ 20 the number of test cases. This is followed by Z test cases. Each test case begins with three space-separated integers: C, T, and L. Each of the following C× T lines gives, respectively, the location and energy consumption of a class. The first T lines represent the classes of category 1, the next T lines represent the classes of category 2, and so on.

Explanation of Sample Input:
Fred must take 3 classes every day, and for each he has 2 choices. The hall has length 5. 
His first possible class is located at position 2 and will take 1 unit of energy each day, etc.

Explanation of Sample Output:
Here is one way to obtain the minimum energy:
Go to the class at location 2. Energy used: 3
Next, go to the class at location 4. Energy used: 6
Then go to the class at location 3. Energy used: 9
Finally, leave the school at location 5. Energy used: 11
