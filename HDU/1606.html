In order to reduce the amount of time required listening to goofy excuses, Judge Ito has asked that you write a program that will search for a list of keywords in a list of excuses identifying lame excuses. Keywords can be matched in an excuse regardless of case. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Input to your program will consist of multiple sets of data. <br><br>Line 1 of each set will contain exactly two integers. The first number (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 20) defines the number of keywords to be used in the search. The second number (1 &lt;= E &lt;= 20) defines the number of excuses in the set to be searched.<br><br>Lines 2 through K+1 each contain exactly one keyword.<br><br>Lines K+2 through K+1+E each contain exactly one excuse.<br><br>All keywords in the keyword list will contain only contiguous lower case alphabetic characters of length L (1 &lt;= L &lt;= 20) and will occupy columns 1 through L in the input line.<br><br>All excuses can contain any upper or lower case alphanumeric character, a space, or any of the following punctuation marks [SPMamp&quot;.,!?&amp;] not including the square brackets and will not exceed 70 characters in length.<br><br>Excuses will contain at least 1 non-space character. <br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each input set, you are to print the worst excuse(s) from the list. <br><br>The worst excuse(s) is/are defined as the excuse(s) which contains the largest number of incidences of keywords.<br><br>If a keyword occurs more than once in an excuse, each occurrence is considered a separate incidence.<br><br>A keyword ``occurs&quot; in an excuse if and only if it exists in the string in contiguous form and is delimited by the beginning or end of the line or any non-alphabetic character or a space. <br><br>For each set of input, you are to print a single line with the number of the set immediately after the string ``Excuse Set #&quot;. (See the Sample Output). The following line(s) is/are to contain the worst excuse(s) one per line exactly as read in. If there is more than one worst excuse, you may print them in any order. <br><br>After each set of output, you should print a blank line. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">5 3
