Every competition is held between two competitors, and surely Dragon's favorite. After each competition he will give a score of either 0 or 1 for each competitor and add it to the total score of that competitor. The total score begins with zero. Here's an example: four competitors with name James, Victoria, Penghu, and Digo. First goes a competition between Penghu and Digo, and Dragon enjoys the competition and draw both 1 score for them. Then there’s a competition between James and Victoria, but this time Dragon draw 1 for Victoria and 0 for James. Lastly a competition between James and Digo is held, but this time Dragon really dislike the competition and give zeroes for each of them. Finally we know the score for each one: James--0, Victoria--1, Penghu--1, Digo--1. All except James are the Winner!<br><br>   However, Dragon's mom comes back home again and close the TV, driving Dragon to his homework, and find out the paper with scores of all competitors. Dragon's mom wants to know how many competition Dragon watched, but it's hard through the paper. Here comes the problem for you, given the scores of all competitors, at least how many competitions had Dragon watched?</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">   The first line of input contains only one integer T(&lt;=10), the number of test cases. Following T blocks, each block describe one test case.<br><br>   For each test case, the first line contains only one integers N(&lt;=100000), which means the number of competitors. Then a line contains N integers (a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>3</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>).a<sub>i</sub>(&lt;=1000000) means the score of i-th competitor.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">   Each output should occupy one line. Each line should start with &quot;Case #i: &quot;, with i implying the case number. Then for each case just puts a line with one integer, implying the competition at least should be watched by dragon.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1
