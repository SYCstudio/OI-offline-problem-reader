He writes posts about technological products almost everyday in his blog.<br><br>   But there is such few comments of his posts that he feels depressed all the day. As his best friend and an excellent programmer, DT asked you to help make his blog look more popular. He is so warm that you have no idea how to refuse. But you are unwilling to read all of his boring posts word by word. So you decided to write a script to comment below his posts automatically.<br><br>   After observation, you found words “Apple” appear everywhere in his posts. After your counting, you concluded that “Apple”, “iPhone”, “iPod”, “iPad” are the most high-frequency words in his blog. Once one of these words were read by your smart script, it will make a comment “MAI MAI MAI!”, and go on reading the post. <br><br>   In order to make it more funny, you, as a fan of Sony, also want to make some comments about Sony. So you want to add a new rule to the script: make a comment “SONY DAFA IS GOOD!” when “Sony” appears.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">   A blog article described above, which contains only printable characters(whose ASCII code is between 32 and 127), CR(ASCII code 13, ‘\r’ in C/C++), LF(ASCII code 10, ‘\n’ in C/C++), please process input until EOF.
