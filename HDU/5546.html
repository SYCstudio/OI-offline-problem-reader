From the historical research, we found that there are much difference on the rules between ancient go and modern go.<br><br>Here is the rules for ancient go they were playing:<br><br>$\cdot$The game is played on a $8×8$ cell board, the chess can be put on the intersection of the board lines, so there are $9×9$ different positions to put the chess.<br>$\cdot$Yu Zhou always takes the black and Su Lu the white. They put the chess onto the game board alternately.<br>$\cdot$The chess of the same color makes connected components(connected by the board lines), for each of the components, if it's not connected with any of the empty cells, this component dies and will be removed from the game board.<br>$\cdot$When one of the player makes his move, check the opponent's components first. After removing the dead opponent's components, check with the player's components and remove the dead components.<br>One day, Yu Zhou was playing ancient go with Su Lu at home. It's Yu Zhou's move now. But they had to go for an emergency military action. Little Qiao looked at the game board and would like to know whether Yu Zhou has a move to kill at least one of Su Lu's chess.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T(1≤T≤100)$. $T$ test cases follow.
