But J was so confused by what F told him that F almost wanted to bully him. At that time, the occurrence of cheat had exactly prevented J from being mistreated any longer.<br>     Now it's the time for F to make the strategy. There are several forts on the map, and each of the two forts has only one route to connect them. What's more, F had been doing something quiet beyond the expectation. He just got each of the forts armed with a large amount of soldiers. But it seemed apparently that F knew J was cheating. So, F determined to alter the proportion of the army. J was definitely getting really misleading By F's distorted strategies. So, he was really anxious of seeking the help of you.<br>     Please number the forts from 1 to n. For instance, the fort ith number of solider is w(i) ( ps. w(i) may be a negative number as F likes. How rediculous!!), there are several tips of instructions that J hope s could help you work out this dilemma problem.<br><b>1. CHANGE u t:</b>  this means that F has the intention that he really want to change present group of the soldiers in fort u to t.<br><b>2. QMAX &nbsp;&nbsp; u v :</b>  this actually indicates that J is curious about what is the max number of the soldiers of a certain forts on the way from u to v.<br><b>3. QSUM &nbsp;&nbsp; u v :</b>  this absolutely expressed that J furiously have the temptation to know the whole number of the army from fort u to fort v.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are several test cases.<br>In each test case, the first line is a positive integer n (1 &lt;=n&lt;=30000) means the number of fort.<br>The next n-1 lines include two numbers a, b (1&lt;=a, b&lt;=n) indicating there is a path between fort a and fort b.<br>The next line has n numbers, the i th number w(i) (-30000&lt;=w(i)&lt;=30000) means the amount of the army in fort i.<br>The following lines has a unique number q (0&lt;=q&lt;=200000), means the total operations in this test case.<br>Above all, q lines will be definitely displayed on screen, each line offers a string like 'CHANGE u t', 'QMAX u v' or 'QSUM u v'.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each string 'QMAX' or 'QSUM', give a number express the result of this request.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">4
