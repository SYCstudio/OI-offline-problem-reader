He had broken the prison and started a big runaway.<br>Scofield has a map of US with cities and bidirectional roads between them. The lengths of roads are known. Some cities get a lot of cops who are very troublesome. Now Scofield needs your help to arrange his runaway route.<br><br>He needs a shortest path between two cities, while the quantity of the police in any city, except the start city and end city, on the route is no more than k.<br><br>You should know that it is very hard to escape. Scofield is very smart but not good at computer. Now Scofield is in trouble, can you help him with your computer? <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input consists of several test cases. There is an integer T on the first line indicating the number of test cases.<br>For each case, the first line consists of two integers N and M. N is the number of cities; M is the number of roads. The next line contains N integers C1, C2...
