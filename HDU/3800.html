Before creating a friendly relationship with the human beings, they make a request that the intelligence of human must be tested. Upon their will, an earth citizen is asked to play the testing game with their boss, and rules of the game are as follows:<br>Given a row of bulbs whose total number is n, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to n from left to right, and each bulb has two states, named turned-on and turned-off. With the citizen from earth starts first, two players make their operations by turns. Every operation they make must meet the conditions:<br>Choose a bulb which is now on, then turn it off, and we assume this bulb is numbered p;<br>Choose a bulb and change its state(if on, then turn off, else, turn on), and suppose it is numbered q, which should meet the request of q &lt;= p/2.<br><br>In addition, the step 2 is not a must.<br>And the one cannot move loses.<br>Eventually, the smart earth citizen wins this test soon.<br><br>However, another question is asked by an evil alien: Supposing there are turned-on bulbs in some sections at the beginning, and the other states can be decided by the citizen from earth.
