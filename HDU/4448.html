The four suits are club (C), heart (H), spade (S), and diamond (D).<br>      Spade 7 is so easy and funny that can be well suited for any ages, No matter a primary school student or a card game expert, even professional bridge masters are addicted to the spade7. And it allows three to seven players playing together.<br>      These are the rules of Spade 7 in a four-player game:<br>      1.Each player receives thirteen cards.<br>      2.The owner of Spade 7 begins by discarding it. Then the players take turns in anti-clockwise order.<br>      3.In each turn, the player needs to discard one valid card, or fold one card when and only when he does not have any valid cards. A valid card is either a 7 of any suits, or touching another card (with the same suit and the difference between their codes is exactly one) which has been discarded by any player in previous turns.<br>      4.The game ends when nobody has cards in his hands.<br>      Every time someone folds a card, he receives penalty points equals to the code of this card. The goal for each player is, to minimize his penalty points.<br>      As pacifists, Alice and three of her best friends are tired of fighting with each other. So they want to try their best to minimize the sum of all four players’ penalty points. Can you help her figure out the best result?</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">      The input begins with a line containing an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 20), the number of test cases.<br>      Each test case contains four lines, describing the cards owned by four players at the beginning, one player per line.
