There are $n$ servers, some servers connect to the gateway whose IP address is 0 directly. All servers are connected with each other by $n$ netting twines. It is said that this structure is favorable for maintaining physical problem of servers.<br>But because of an unexpected rainstorm, the computer room was destroyed by a terrible thunderclap!<br>Our maintainer Bittersweet found that many servers were not able to be visited, so he hurried to the computer room to lookup the reason. After several hours, Bittersweet realized that some net gape of servers were broken by thunderclap. However, there were too many servers to find out all the broken net gapes quickly. So he came up with an idea to assess the damaged condition roughly. Bittersweet decided to turn on some servers and ping other servers randomly, then record the unsuccessful pairs of servers.<br>Now he need a program to analyze the record to confirm what is the $minimum$ number of servers whose net gape was destroyed by thunderclap. Can you help him to complete this work?<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are at most 20 test cases.<br>In each test case, the first line is an integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 10^4$), denoting the number of servers.
