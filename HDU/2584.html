Then,it's called that X is absolutely better than Y.Using the &quot;absolutely better&quot;concept, it becomes better to compare some paires of Universities.<br>    Now Bob has the complete rangkings of different departments of many universities,and he wants to find k universities(U1,u2,....Uk)such that Ui is absolutely better that Uj(for any i&lt;j).</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line of the input is a positive integer C.C is the number of test cases <br>followed.<br>    The first line of each test case is two positive integers N,M(0&lt;N,M&lt;=100),N  is the number of the universities and M is the number of departments.And then M lines follow.The i(th)(1&lt;=i&lt;=M)line contains N numbers Ui(1&lt;=i&lt;=N,1&lt;=Ui&lt;=N),indicating the ranking of the i(th)department.If Universitites Ui preceds to University Uj in line k(th department, then the k(th)department do Ui  is better than k(th) department of Uj.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The output should consist fo C lines, one lines for each test case.Each line only constains one integer- the maximum values fo k as descriped above.No redundant spaces are needed.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1
