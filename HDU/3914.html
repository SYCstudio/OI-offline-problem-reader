Gameplay in the series often centers around jumping on and defeating enemies. The games usually feature simple plots; the most common theme is that of Bowser, the primary antagonist, kidnapping Princess Peach, whom Mario saves. Despite the plots usually being very simple, the Mario role-playing games tend to have deeper plots, often involving enemies other than Bowser (many of which involve Bowser actually teaming up with Mario), with aspirations for world domination. Mario has been featured in 200 games, and the series has sold over 200 million copies total, making it the best-selling video game series of all time.<br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/C362-1004-1.jpg></center> <br>Today,Mario comes to a forest,whick has many apple trees.These trees are special,the apples are grown in the nodes of the tree,whick is shown as follow.<br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/C362-1004-2.jpg></center> <br>Numbers in the nodes indicate the amount of apples which are also in this node.

Before each jump, he has to eat an apple, and after he eat an apple he have to jump up or down. Mario can walk along the roads too. He can walk along a road with at most an apple, or without any apple. These walks need not any apples. He can <b>finish his journey at any root</b>. All the nodes, including normal node and root node, are numbered together from 1 to M.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;How many apples is Mario able to eat at most?<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Multiple cases, you need process to EOF. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;First line contains N, M and S, where N indicates the number of roots, M indicates the number of nodes, and S indicates the start root’s number. 0&lt; N&lt;M &lt;= 20000, S is in the range of [1, M].<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every next N lines contains “ID T A<sub>1</sub> … A<sub>T</sub>”, where ID indicates a node-number of root.
