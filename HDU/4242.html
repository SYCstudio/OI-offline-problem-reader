As shown in the figure, Al's tract is to be bounded by the line from A to B, the line from A to the midpoint of BC and the line from B to the midpoint of CD' Bob&amp;s  ract is to be bounded by the line from B to C, the line from B to the midpoint of CD and the line from C to the midpoint of DA, and so on. <br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/C397-1007-1.jpg></center><br>Your job is to write a program that will help Rancher Joel determine the area of each child's tract and the length of the fence he will have to put around Emily's parcel to keep her brothers' cows out of her crops.   <br> <br>For his problem, A will always be at (0, 0) and B will always be at (x, 0). Coordinates will be in rods (a rod is 16.5 feet).The returned areas should be in acres to 3 decimal places (an acre is 160 square rods) and the length of the fence should be in feet, rounded up to the next foot.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line of input contains a single integer P( 1 &lt;= P &lt;= 1000),which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set is a single line that contains of a decimal integer followed by five (5) space separated floating-point values. The first (integer) value is the data set number, N. The floating-point values are B.x, C.x, C.y, D.x and D.y in that order (where V.x indicates the x coordinate of V and V.y indicates the y coordinate of V). Recall that the y coordinate of B is always zero (0). The supplied coordinates will always specify a valid convex quadrilateral.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each data set there is a single line of output. It contains the data set number,  N , followed by a single space followed by five(5) space separated floating-point values to three(3) decimal place accuracy, followed by a single space and a decimal integer!  The floating-point values are the areas in acres of the properties of Al, Bob, Chas, Dave, and Emily respectively. The final integer is the length of fence in feet required to fence in Emily's property (rounded up to the next foot). </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">3
