Every vertex in this graph has an integer value assigned to it at the beginning. You're also given a sequence of operations and you need to process them as requested. Here's a list of the possible operations that you might encounter:<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Deletes an edge from the graph.<br>The format is [D X], where X is an integer from 1 to M, indicating the ID of the edge that you should delete. It is guaranteed that no edge will be deleted more than once.<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Queries the weight of the vertex with K-th maximum value among all vertexes currently connected with vertex X (including X itself).<br>The format is [Q X K], where X is an integer from 1 to N, indicating the id of the vertex, and you may assume that K will always fit into a 32-bit signed integer. In case K is illegal, the value for that query will be considered as undefined, and you should return 0 as the answer to that query.<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes the weight of a vertex.<br>The format is [C X V], where X is an integer from 1 to N, and V is an integer within the range [-10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>].<br><br>The operations end with one single character, E, which indicates that the current case has ended.<br>For simplicity, you only need to output one real number - the average answer of all queries.<br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are multiple test cases in the input file. Each case starts with two integers N and M (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>, 0 &lt;= M &lt;= 6 * 10<sup>4</sup>), the number of vertexes in the graph. The next N lines describes the initial weight of each vertex (-106 &lt;= weight[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup>). The next part of each test case describes the edges in the graph at the beginning. Vertexes are numbered from 1 to N. The last part of each test case describes the operations to be performed on the graph. It is guaranteed that the number of query operations [Q X K] in each case will be in the range [1, 2 * 10<sup>5</sup>], and there will be no more than 2 * 10<sup>5</sup> operations that change the values of the vertexes [C X V].<br><br>There will be a blank line between two successive cases. A case with N = 0, M = 0 indicates the end of the input file and this case should not be processed by your program.<br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, output one real number – the average answer of all queries, in the format as indicated in the sample output.

D 3 -- deletes the 3rd edge in the graph (the remaining edges are (1, 2) and (2, 3))
Q 1 2 -- finds the vertex with the second largest value among all vertexes connected with 1. The answer is 20.
Q 2 1 -- finds the vertex with the largest value among all vertexes connected with 2. The answer is 30.
D 2 -- deletes the 2nd edge in the graph (the only edge left after this operation is (1, 2))
Q 3 2 -- finds the vertex with the second largest value among all vertexes connected with 3.  The answer is 0 (Undefined).
C 1 50 -- changes the value of vertex 1 to 50.
Q 1 1 -- finds the vertex with the largest value among all vertex connected with 1. The answer is 50.
E -- This is the end of the current test case. Four queries have been evaluated, and the answer to this case is (20 + 30 + 0 + 50) / 4 = 25.000.

For the second sample, caution about the vertex with same weight:
Q 1 1 – the answer is 20
Q 1 2 – the answer is 20
Q 1 3 – the answer is 10
