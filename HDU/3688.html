Chandler and his team take responsibility to guard it. There are some searchlights on some pieces and each of them has a capability to lighten a distance towards four directions: north, south, east and west. Different searchlight has different lightening capability shown in levels. Searchlight with level k means that it can lighten k grids (including the gird that the searchlight stands in) along any of the four directions. Shown in following figure, there is a searchlight of level 3 and the shadow grids are ones that can be lightened by it. Particularly, searchlight of level 1 means that it can only lighten the grid in which the searchlight stands.<br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/3688-1.gif></center> <br>Each searchlight has a maximum level. You can decrease a searchlight’s level to save the energy. A searchlight whose maximum level is k can be turned to level k, k-1, k-2, …, 1 and 0. Level 0 means turning off the searchlight. <br><br>A grid is well-guarded if and only if <b>at least</b> one of the following two conditions is satisfied:<br>1.There is a searchlight in this grid, and it is not switched to level 0 (the light is on).<br>2.The grid is lightened by <b>at least</b> two searchlights. One lightens it in horizontal direction (east or west), and another lightens it in vertical direction (north or south).<br><br>Chandler asks you to help finding a solution that he can turn on some of the searchlights so that:<br>1.All the grids are well-guarded.<br>2.All the searchlights turned on are in a same level.<br>3.That same level mentioned above is as small as possible.<br>More specifically, if you choose a same level Q, then all the searchlights whose maximum level are less than Q have to be turned off. Please help him to find a solution with the minimum same level.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input file contains several test cases. <br><br>For each test case, the first line is two integers n and m, representing a grids land of size n×m.
