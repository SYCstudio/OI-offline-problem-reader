A single diner or a group of two diners should be arranged to a two-seat table, a group of three or four diners should be arranged to a four-seat table, and a group of five or six diners should be arranged to a six-seat table.<br><br>Flo’s restaurant serves delicious food, and many people like to eat here. Every day when lunch time comes, the restaurant is usually full of diners. If there is no suitable table for a new coming group of diners, they have to wait until some suitable table is free and there isn’t an earlier arrival group waiting for the same kind of tables. Kind Flo will tell them how long they will get their seat, and if it’s longer than half an hour, they will leave for another restaurant.<br><br>Now given the list of coming diners in a day, please calculate how many diners take their food in Flo’s restaurant. You may assume it takes half an hour for every diner from taking a seat to leaving the restaurant.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are several test cases. The first line of each case contains there positive integers separated by blanks, A, B and C (A, B, C &gt;0, A + B + C &lt;= 100), which are the number of two-seat tables, the number of four-seat tables and the number of six-seat tables respectively. From the second line, there is a list of coming groups of diners, each line of which contains two integers, T and N (0 &lt; N &lt;= 6), representing the arrival time and the number of diners of each group. The arrival time T is denoted by HH:MM, and fixed between 08:00 and 22:00 (the restaurant closes at 23:00). The list is sorted by the arrival time of each group in an ascending order, and you may assume that no groups arrive at the same time. Each test case is ended by a line of “#”.<br><br>A test case with A = B = C = 0 ends the input, and should not be processed.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, you should output an integer, the total number of diners who take their food in Flo’s restaurant, in a separated line.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1 1 1
