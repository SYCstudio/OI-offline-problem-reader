We say two village A and B are connected, if and only if there is a road between A and B, or there exists a village C such that there is a road between A and C, and C and B are connected. <br><br>We know that there are already some roads between some villages and your job is the build some roads such that all the villages are connect and the length of all the roads built is minimum.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line is an integer N (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 100), which is the number of villages. Then come N lines, the i-th of which contains N integers, and the j-th of these N integers is the distance (the distance should be an integer within [1, 1000]) between village i and village j.<br><br>Then there is an integer Q (0 &lt;= Q &lt;= N * (N + 1) / 2). Then come Q lines, each line contains two integers a and b (1 &lt;= a &lt; b &lt;= N), which means the road between village a and village b has been built.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">You should output a line contains an integer, which is the length of all the roads to be built such that all the villages are connected, and this value is minimum. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">3
