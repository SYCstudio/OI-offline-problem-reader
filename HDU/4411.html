City 0 is where police headquarter located. The economy of other cities numbered from 1 to N ruined these years because they are all controlled by mafia. The police plan to catch all the mafia gangs in these N cities all over the year, and they want to succeed in a single mission. They figure out that every city except city 0 lives a mafia gang, and these gangs have a simple urgent message network: if the gang in city i (i&gt;1) is captured, it will send an urgent message to the gang in city i-1 and the gang in city i -1 will get the message immediately. <br>The mission must be carried out very carefully. Once a gang received an urgent message, the mission will be claimed failed.<br>You are given the map of TAT island which is an undirected graph. The node on the graph represents a city, and the weighted edge represents a road between two cities(the weight means the length). Police headquarter has sent k squads to arrest all the mafia gangs in the rest N cities. When a squad passes a city, it can choose to arrest the gang in the city or to do nothing. These squads should return to city 0 after the arrest mission.<br>You should ensure the mission to be successful, and then minimize the total length of these squads traveled.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are multiple test cases.<br>Each test case begins with a line with three integers N, M and k, here M is the number of roads among N+1 cities. Then, there are M lines. Each of these lines contains three integers X, Y, Len, which represents a Len kilometer road between city X and city Y. Those cities including city 0 are connected. <br>The input is ended by “0 0 0”.<br>Restrictions: 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ M ≤ 4000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 25, 0 ≤ Len ≤ 1000<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case,output a single line with a single integer that represents the minimum total length of these squads traveled.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">3 4 2
