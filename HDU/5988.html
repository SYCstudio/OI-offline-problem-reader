The whole playground would be divided into N blocks, and there would be M directed paths linking these blocks. The i-th path goes from the $u_i$-th block to the $v_i$-th block. Your task is to solve the lunch issue. According to the arrangement, there are $s_i$ competitors in the i-th block. Limited to the size of table, $b_i$ bags of lunch including breads, sausages and milk would be put in the i-th block. As a result, some competitors need to move to another block to access lunch. However, the playground is temporary, as a result there would be so many wires on the path.<br>For the i-th path, the wires have been stabilized at first and the first competitor who walker through it would not break the wires. Since then, however, when a person go through the i - th path, there is a chance of $p_i$ to touch<br>the wires and affect the whole networks. Moreover, to protect these wires, no more than $c_i$ competitors are allowed to walk through the i-th path.<br>Now you need to find a way for all competitors to get their lunch, and minimize the possibility of network crashing.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line of input contains an integer t which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.<br>For each test case, the first line consists of two integers N (N ≤ 100) and M (M ≤ 5000). Each of the next N lines contains two integers si and $b_i$ ($s_i$ , $b_i$ ≤ 200).<br>Each of the next M lines contains three integers $u_i$ , $v_i$ and $c_i(c_i$ ≤ 100) and a float-point number $p_i$(0 &lt; $p_i$ &lt; 1).<br>It is guaranteed that there is at least one way to let every competitor has lunch.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each turn of each case, output the minimum possibility that the networks would break down.
