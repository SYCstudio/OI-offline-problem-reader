And for others, she can do of her will. We just define the things that she can choose as &quot;jobs&quot;. A job takes time , and gives xiaoA some points of happiness (which means that she is always willing to do the jobs).So can you choose the best sets of them to give her the maximum points of happiness and also to be a good junior(which means that she should follow the boss's advice)?<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are several test cases, each test case begins with two integers n and T (0&lt;=n,T&lt;=100) , n sets of jobs for you to choose and T minutes for her to do them.
