The blue army finds that Little A is the spy of the red army, so Little A has to escape from the headquarters of the blue army to that of the red army. The battle field is a rectangle of size m*n, and the headquarters of the blue army and the red army are placed at (0, 0) and (m, n), respectively, which means that Little A will go from (0, 0) to (m, n). The picture below denotes the shape of the battle field and the notation of directions that we will use later.<br><br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/3533-1.jpg></center> <br><br>The blue army is eager to revenge, so it tries its best to kill Little A during his escape. The blue army places many castles, which will shoot to a fixed direction periodically. It costs Little A one unit of energy per second, whether he moves or not. If he uses up all his energy or gets shot at sometime, then he fails. Little A can move north, south, east or west, one unit per second. Note he may stay at times in order not to be shot.<br>To simplify the problem, let’s assume that Little A cannot stop in the middle of a second. He will neither get shot nor block the bullet during his move, which means that a bullet can only kill Little A at positions with integer coordinates. Consider the example below. The bullet moves from (0, 3) to (0, 0) at the speed of 3 units per second, and Little A moves from (0, 0) to (0, 1) at the speed of 1 unit per second. Then Little A is not killed. But if the bullet moves 2 units per second in the above example, Little A will be killed at (0, 1).<br>Now, please tell Little A whether he can escape.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For every test case, the first line has four integers, m, n, k and d (2&lt;=m, n&lt;=100, 0&lt;=k&lt;=100, m+ n&lt;=d&lt;=1000). m and n are the size of the battle ground, k is the number of castles and d is the units of energy Little A initially has. The next k lines describe the castles each. Each line contains a character c and four integers, t, v, x and y. Here c is ‘N’, ‘S’, ‘E’ or ‘W’ giving the direction to which the castle shoots, t is the period, v is the velocity of the bullets shot (i.e. units passed per second), and (x, y) is the location of the castle. Here we suppose that if a castle is shot by other castles, it will block others’ shots but will NOT be destroyed. And two bullets will pass each other without affecting their directions and velocities.<br>All castles begin to shoot when Little A starts to escape.<br>Proceed to the end of file.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">If Little A can escape, print the minimum time required in seconds on a single line.
