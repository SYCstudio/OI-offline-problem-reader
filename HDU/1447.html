Among all the nineteen children in his family, Joseph was the youngest and the smartest. He began to show his interest in mathematics when he was very young. After he grew up, he often corresponded with C. Bonard (a professor of mathematics at Auxerre) by exchanging letters. <br><br>In one letter written to Bonard, Fourier asked a question: how to draw 17 lines on a plane to make exactly 101 crossings, where each crossing belongs to exactly two lines. Obviously, this is an easy problem, and Figure-1 is a solution that satisfies his requirement. Now the problem for you is a universal one. Can we draw N lines on a plane to make exactly M crossings, where each crossing belongs to exactly two lines? If we can, how many pieces, at most, can these lines cut the plane into?<br><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/1447-1.jpg><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input may have several sets of test data. Each set is one line containing two integers N and M (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100, 0 &lt;= M &lt;= 10000), separated by a space. The test data is followed by a line containing two zeros, which indicates the end of input and should not be processed as a set of data.<br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Output one line for each set of input in the following format:<br><br>Case i: N lines cannot make exactly M crossings. <br><br>if the drawing of these lines is impossible; <br><br>or: <br><br>Case i: N lines with exactly M crossings can cut the plane into K pieces at most. <br><br>Note: Even if N or M equals to one, you should use the words &quot;lines&quot; and &quot;crossings&quot; in your output. <br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">4 3
