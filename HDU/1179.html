'Yes,yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon,Harry Potter.'It wasn't a question.You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself,buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.' <br>Mor Ollivander moved closer to Harry.Harry wished he would blink.Those sivery eyes were a bit creepy. <br>'Your father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand.Eleven inches.Pliable.A little more power and excellent for transfiguration.Well ,I say your father favoured it - it's really the wand that choosed the wizard, of cource.' <br><br>Yes, some wands fit some wizards ,as we all know.But what Harry doesn't know is Ollivander have met a big trouble.That's more than twenty years ago,When Harry's father James Potter was still a student in Hogwarts.He went Diagon Alley to buy new books,passing by Ollivander's shop.Ollivander was crazy for a problem:He was too busy to choose most suitable wand for every wizard.Even more,there are too many customer that day.Though Ollivader knew every wand's favourite,he could not choose as many wizards as possible to get the wands. So James Potter,a very clever man ,gave him a magic disk with your program ,to help him sell wands as many as possible. <br><br>Please notice: one wand can only be sold to one wizard, and one wizard can only buy one wand,too. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are several cases.

Wand 1 fits everyone, Wand 2,3 only fit the first wizard,and Wand 4 does not fit anyone.So Ollivanders can sell two wands:
sell Wand 1 to Wizard 2 and Wand 2 to Wizard 1,or sell Wand 1 to Wizard 3 and Wand 3 to Wizard 1 ,or some other cases. But 
he cannot sell 3 wands because no 3 wands just fit 3 wizards.</div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">数据范围与提示</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"> <a href="/search.php?field=problem&key=Gardon-DYGG+Contest+1&source=1&searchmode=source"> Gardon-DYGG Contest 1 </a> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ui vertical footer segment"><div class="ui center aligned container"><span style="color: #999;">OI-offline-problem-reader Powered by <a href="http://www.sycstudio.com">SYCstudio</a>.</span></div></div></div></body></html>
