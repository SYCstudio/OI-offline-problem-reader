Initially controversial, set theory has come to play the role of a foundational theory in modern mathematics, in the sense of a theory invoked to justify assumptions made inmathematics concerning the existence of mathematical objects (such as numbers or functions) and their properties. Formal versions of set theory also have a foundational role to play as specifying a theoretical ideal of mathematical rigor in proofs.?Given this importance of sets, being the basis of mathematics, a set of eccentric theorist set off to construct a supercomputer operating on sets instead of numbers. The initial Set-Stack Alpha is under construction, and they need you to simulate it in order to verify the operation of the prototype.<br><br><img style='max-width:100%;' src=data/images/1968-1.jpg><br><br>The computer operates on a single stack of sets, which is initially empty. After each operation, the cardinality of the topmost set on the stack is output. The cardinality of a set S is denoted |S| and is the number of elements in S. The instruction set of the SetStack Alpha is PUSH, DUP, UNION, INTERSECT, and ADD.<br>?PUSH will push the empty set {} on the stack.<br>?DUP will duplicate the topmost set (pop the stack, and then push that set on the stack twice).<br>?UNION will pop the stack twice and then push the union of the two sets on the stack. <br>?INTERSECT will pop the stack twice and then push the intersection of the two sets on the stack.<br>?ADD will pop the stack twice, add the first set to the second one, and then push the resulting set on the stack.<br>For illustration purposes, assume that the topmost element of the stack is A = {{}, {{}}} and that the next one is B = {{}, {{{}}}}.<br>For these sets, we have |A| = 2 and |B| = 2. Then: <br>?UNION would result in the set { {}, {{}}, {{{}}} }. The output is 3.<br>?INTERSECT would result in the set { {} }. The output is 1.<br>?ADD would result in the set { {}, {{{}}}, {{},{{}}} }. The output is 3.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">An integer 0 &lt;= T &lt;= 5 on the first line gives the cardinality of the set of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the number of operations 0 &lt;= N &lt;= 2 000. Then follow N lines each containing one of the five commands. It is guaranteed that the SetStack computer can execute all the commands in the sequence without ever popping an empty stack.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each operation specified in the input, there will be one line of output consisting of a single integer.
