He can’t fly, but he could jump from housetop to housetop. Today he plans to use N houses to hone his house  hopping  skills.  He will  start  at  the shortest  house and make N-1  jumps, with each  jump  taking  him  to a  taller  house than  the one  he is  jumping  from. When finished, he will have been on every house exactly once, traversing them in increasing order of height, and ending up on the tallest house.  <br>The man can travel for at most a certain horizontal distance D in a single jump. To make this as much fun as possible, the crazy man want to maximize the distance between the positions of the shortest house and the tallest house. <br>The crazy super man have an ability—move houses. So he is going to move the houses subject to the following constraints:<br>1. All houses are to be moved along a one-dimensional path. <br>2. Houses must be moved at integer locations along the path, with no two houses at the same location. <br>3. Houses must be arranged so their moved ordering from left to right is the same as their ordering in the input. They must NOT be sorted by height, or reordered in any way. They must be kept in their stated order. <br>4. The super man can only jump so far, so every house must be moved close enough to the next taller house. Specifically, they must be no further than D apart on the ground (the difference in their heights doesn't matter). <br>Given N houses, in a specified order, each with a distinct integer height, help  the super man  figure out the maximum possible distance they can put between the shortest house and the tallest house, and be able to use the houses for training. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">In the first line there is an integer T, indicates the number of test cases.(T&lt;=500)<br>Each test case begins with a line containing two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) and D (1 ≤ D ≤1000000). The next  line contains N integer, giving the heights of the N houses, in  the order that they should be moved. Within a test case, all heights will be unique.   <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case , output “Case %d: “first where d is the case number counted from one, then output a single integer representing the maximum distance between  the shortest and  tallest  house, subject  to  the constraints above, or -1 if it is impossible to lay out the houses.
