Thus we can say that a year consists of:<br>12 months (of differing lengths) <br>52 (and a bit) weeks <br>365 days <br>8,760 hours <br>525,600 minutes <br>31,536,000 seconds. <br>Most of these numbers need to be adjusted in leap years.<br><br>A k'th anniversary of a date is usually defined as the same date (month and day) k years later, thus the 10th anniversary of 17th May 1983 is 17th May 1993. However we can also define other types of `versaries' - the 1 week-versary of 28th February 1984 is 6th March 1984.<br><br>If we define a convention of naming dates (and times if necessary) by specifying successively smaller periods separated by colons (that is as yyyy:mm:dd:hh:mm:ss) we can label the units using the same convention, that is y for years, d for days, w for weeks, h for hours, m for minutes and s for seconds (we cannot use months, they are too variable). We can then summarise the above examples as:<br>1983:5:17 + 10y -&gt; 1993:5:17<br>1984:2:28 + 1w -&gt; 1984:3:6 <br>Note that the specification of an event has to be as least as precise (that is employ units at least as small) as the specification of the desired versary.<br><br>Write a program that will read in details of events and desired versaries and calculate the required date (and time if necessary). Bear in mind that a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 unless it is divisible by 100 as well, in which case it is only a leap year if it is divisible by 400; thus 1984 and 2000 are leap years, but 1900 is not.<br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Input will consist of a series of lines, each line a specification of an event and a desired versary. The input will follow the format shown below, except that where one space is shown there may be more than one space. The event will be specified at least to the same precision as the desired versary. All events will start in this century, and no versary will be more than 100 years (or equivalent). Note that midnight starts a day rather than terminates it and thus is written as 0:0:0 and not as 24:0:0.
