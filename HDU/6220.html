Each unit and towerhas some hit points (HP) and a fixed attack power (AP). The units (resp. towers) with positive HP are surviving and can attack the towers (resp. units), and the units (resp. towers) with zero HP are dead (resp. destroyed) andcannot attack anything.<br>The game is real-time and the time goes continuously. If a tower (resp. unit) is being attacked by k units (resp.towers) with the AP of $a_1, a_2, ... , a_k$ at the same time, then its HP will continuously decrease with the rate of $a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_k$ per second. There is no restriction on attack ranges. That is, any unit can attack any towers andvice versa.<br>During the whole game, the surviving units (resp. towers) will attack a selected tower (resp. unit) together untilit has been destroyed (resp. killed). That is, the surviving units (resp. towers) will focus to destroy (resp. kill) the towers (resp. units) one by one.<br>If all the units are killed and there is at least a surviving tower, the tower team wins. If all the towers are destroyed and there is at least a surviving unit, the unit team wins. If all the units are killed and all the towers are destroyed at the same time, the game ends in a tie.<br>Both teams play optimally. Your task is to predict the winner of the game.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line is the number of test cases up to 10.<br>For each test case, there are 5 lines.
