In the forest, there was a very naughty cat, named Jim. One day, when Jim played in the forest, he was attracted by a beautiful butterfly and followed the butterfly, he went into the dire area, the Black Forest<br><br>An evil wizard lived in the Black Forest, he would kill anyone who entered the forest, and had a good meal with their bodies. Obviously, Jim knew what would happen to him. As a clever cat, Jim came up an idea quickly, that is, calling for help.<br><br>Unfortunately, the wizard trapped Jim with a magic called Maze, and then he went home prepered for the delicious cat-meet-dinner. He would come back at time T.<br><br>The magic Maze transmits somebody to a special square. At there, one must solve a riddle to get out, or waiting for powerful wizard to dispel the Maze.<br><br>On the square, there are N rows stone. Each row has M stones. Each stone has its own number, and there are M pieces of stone whose number is k(1&lt;=k&lt;=N). Only all the stone in kth row has the same number k, the person can exit the Maze.<br><br>Certainly, Jim didn't want to become a cat-meet-dinner, so he asked you for help.<br><br>You can assume Jim would take 1 time from one row to any row (nomatter he took a stone or not), and when start (time 0), he could go to any row he likes.<br><br>Notice: even Jim can get out of magic Maze, he also need at least 1 time to call for help.(After that he would save by SuperCat and Wizard would lost his cat-meet-dinner. Clearly he might be crazy and do something terrible. For exmaple, he might summon some vampire to catch the cat Jim and then destroy the Happy Forest:( After all, he was a dread wizard.)</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line contains N (the number of row, 1&lt;=N&lt;=10000), M (the number of stone in each row, 1&lt;=M&lt;=100), T(the time mentioned before, T&lt;=2^32), Each of the next N lines contains M numbers in the range from 1 to N.
