Some of the university buildings are old as well. And the navigation in old buildings can sometimes be a little bit tricky, because of strange long corridors that fork and join at absolutely unexpected places. <br><br>The result is that some first-graders have often di?culties finding the right way to their classes. Therefore, the Student Union has developed a computer game to help the students to practice their orientation skills. The goal of the game is to find the way out of a labyrinth. Your task is to write a verification software that solves this game. <br><br>The labyrinth is a 2-dimensional grid of squares, each square is either free or filled with a wall. Some of the free squares may contain doors or keys. There are four di?erent types of keys and doors: blue, yellow, red, and green. Each key can open only doors of the same color. <br><br>You can move between adjacent free squares vertically or horizontally, diagonal movement is not allowed. You may not go across walls and you cannot leave the labyrinth area. If a square contains a door, you may go there only if you have stepped on a square with an appropriate key before. </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input consists of several maps. Each map begins with a line containing two integer numbers R and C (1 ≤ R, C ≤ 100) specifying the map size. Then there are R lines each containing C characters. Each character is one of the following: <br><br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/C106-1004-1.JPG></center><br><br>Note that it is allowed to have <br> <li> more than one exit, </li><br> <li> no exit at all, </li><br> <li> more doors and/or keys of the same color, and </li><br> <li> keys without corresponding doors and vice versa. </li><br><br>You may assume that the marker of your position (“*”) will appear exactly once in every map. <br><br>There is one blank line after each map. The input is terminated by two zeros in place of the map size. </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each map, print one line containing the sentence “Escape possible in S steps.”, where S is the smallest possible number of step to reach any of the exits. If no exit can be reached, output the string “The poor student is trapped!” instead. <br><br>One step is defined as a movement between two adjacent cells. Grabbing a key or unlocking a door does not count as a step. </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1 10
