V voters attend the election, each casting their vote for one of N political parties. Mofficials will be elected into the parliament.<br>The conversion from votes to parliament seats is done using the D'Hondt method with a 5% threshold.More precisely, suppose that the parties are numbered 1 through N and that they receive V1, V2, ..., VN votes. Parliament seats are allocated as follows:<br>1. All parties that receive strictly less than 5% of V votes are erased from the list of parties.<br>2. The parliament is initially empty i.e. every party has zero seats allocated.<br>3. For each party P, the quotient QP=VP/(SP+1) is calculated, where VP is the total number of votes received by party P, and SP is the number of seats already allocated to party P.<br>4. The party with the largest quotient QP is allocated one seat. If multiple parties have the same largest quotient, the lower numbered party wins the seat.<br>5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the parliament is full.<br>The votes are being counted and only part of the V votes has been tallied. It is known how many votes each party has received so far.Write a program that calculates for each party, among all possible outcomes of the election after all V votes are counted, the largest and smallest number of seats the party wins.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The first line contains the integers V, N and M (1 ≤ V ≤ 10,000,000, 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ M ≤ 200), the numbers of votes, parties and seats in the parliament.<br>The second line contains N integers – how many votes (of those that have been counted) each party got.

In the first example 14 votes have been tallied and 6 are yet to be counted. To illustrate one possible outcome, suppose that the first party receives 2 of those 6 votes, 
the second none, the third 1 vote and the fourth 3 votes. The parties' totals are 6, 3, 7 and 4 votes. All parties exceeded the 5% threshold.
Seats are allocated as follows:
1. The quotients are initially 6/1, 3/1, 7/1 and 4/1; the largest is 7/1 so party 3 wins a seat.
2. The quotients are 6/1, 3/1, 7/2 and 4/1; the largest is 6/1 so party 1 wins a seat.
3. The quotients are 6/2, 3/1, 7/2 and 4/1; the largest is 4/1 so party 4 wins a seat.
4. The quotients are 6/2, 3/1, 7/2 and 4/2; the largest is 7/2 so party 3 wins a seat.
5. The quotients are 6/2, 3/1, 7/3 and 4/2; parties 1 and 2 are tied with quotients 6/2 and 3/1,but party 1 is lower numbered so it wins the last seat.

In this outcome, the numbers of seats won by the parties are 2, 0, 2 and 1. Since it is possible for the second party not to win any seats, the second number
 on the second line of output is zero.
