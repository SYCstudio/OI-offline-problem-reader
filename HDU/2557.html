If you have ever tried to get a train ticket at that time, you must have witnessed the endless queues in front of every ticket box window. If a guy has seen his friend in a queue, then it is very much likely that this lucky guy might go straight to his friend and ask for a favor. This is called &quot;jumping the queue&quot;. It is unfair to the rest of the people in the line, but, it is life. Your task is to write a program that simulates such a queue with people jumping in every now and then, assume that, if one in the queue has several friends asking for favors, he would arrange their requests in a queue of his own.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There will contain one or more test cases. Each test case begins with the number of groups n (1&lt;= n &lt;=1000). Then n group descriptions follow, each one consisting of the number of friends belonging to the group and those people's distinct names. A group is a friend group. People in one group are friend with each other. A name is a string of up to 4 characters chosen from {A, B, ..., Z, a, b, ..., z}. A group may consist of up to 1000 friends. You may assume that there is no one belong to two different groups. <br>Finally, a list of commands follows. There are three different kinds of commands: <br><br>● <b>ENQUEUE X</b> - Mr. or Ms. X goes into the queue <br>● <b>DEQUEUE</b> - the first person gets the ticket and leave the queue <br>● <b>STOP</b> - end of test case <br><br>The input will be terminated by a value of 0 for n.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each test case, first print a line saying &quot;Scenario #k&quot;, where k is the number of the test case. Then, for each <b>DEQUEUE</b> command, print the person who just gets a ticket on a single line. Print a blank line between two test cases, but no extra line at the end of output.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">2

You must maintain a hash table to store the names of the people, otherwise the efficiency of your program will not be acceptable since Judge's input file
 is as large as about 12.5MB.
