HyperCommodities wants to import goods from some of the galaxies in the Plural Z sector. Planets within these galaxies export valuable products and raw materials like vacuuseal, transparent aluminum, digraphite, and quantum steel. Preliminary reports have revealed the following facts: <br><br><br>Each galaxy contains at least one and at most 26 planets. Each planet within a galaxy is identified by a unique letter from A to Z. <br><br>Each planet specializes in the production and export of one good. Different planets within the same galaxy export different goods. <br><br>Some pairs of planets are connected by hyperspace shipping lines. If planets A and B are connected, they can trade goods freely. If planet C is connected to B but not to A, then A and C can still trade goods with each other through B, but B keeps 5% of the shipment as a shipping fee. (Thus A only receives 95% of what C shipped, and C receives only 95% of what A shipped.) In general, any two planets can trade goods as long as they are connected by some set of shipping lines, but each intermediate planet along the shipping route keeps 5% of what it shipped (which is not necessarily equal to 5% of the original shipment). <br><br>At least one planet in each galaxy is willing to open a ThrustoZoom shipping line to Earth. A ThrustoZoom line is the same as any other shipping line within the galaxy, as far as business is concerned. For example, if planet K opens a ThrustoZoom line to Earth, then the Earth can trade goods freely with K, or it can trade goods with any planet connected to K, subject to the usual shipping fees. <br><br>HyperCommodities has assigned a relative value (a positive real number less than 10) to each planet's chief export. The higher the number, the more valuable the product. More valuable products can be resold with a higher profit margin in domestic markets. The problem is to determine which planet has the most valuable export when shipping fees are taken into account. </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input consists of one or more galaxy descriptions. Each galaxy description begins with a line containing an integer N which specifies the number of planets in the galaxy. The next N lines contain descriptions of each planet, which consist of: <br><br><br>1) The letter used to represent the planet. <br><br>2) A space. <br><br>3) The relative value of the planet's export, in the form d.dd. <br><br>4) A space. <br><br>5) A string containing letters and/or the character `*'; a letter indicates a shipping line to that planet, and a `*' indicates a willingness to open a ThrustoZoom shipping line to Earth. <br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">For each galaxy description, output a single line which reads &quot;Import from P&quot; where P is the letter of the planet with the most valuable export, once shipping fees have been taken into account.
