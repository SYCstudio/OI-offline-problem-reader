Rather than deal with the difficulties of constructing a model of the Earth (a somewhat oblate spheroid), consider a pre-Columbian flat world that is a 500 kilometer  500 kilometer square. <br><br>In the model used in this problem, the flat world consists of several warring kingdoms. Though warlike, the people of the world are strict isolationists; each kingdom is surrounded by a high (but thin) wall designed to both protect the kingdom and to isolate it. To avoid fights for power, each kingdom has its own electric power plant. <br><br>When the urge to fight becomes too great, the people of a kingdom often launch missiles at other kingdoms. Each SCUD missile (anitary leansing niversal estroyer) that lands within the walls of a kingdom destroys that kingdom's power plant (without loss of life). <br><br><br>Given coordinate locations of several kingdoms (by specifying the locations of houses and the location of the power plant in a kingdom) and missile landings you are to write a program that determines the total area of all kingdoms that are without power after an exchange of missile fire. <br><br>In the simple world of this problem kingdoms do not overlap. Furthermore, the walls surrounding each kingdom are considered to be of zero thickness. The wall surrounding a kingdom is the minimal-perimeter wall that completely surrounds all the houses and the power station that comprise a kingdom; the area of a kingdom is the area enclosed by the minimal-perimeter thin wall. <br><br>There is exactly one power station per kingdom. <br><br>There may be empty space between kingdoms. <br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The input is a sequence of kingdom specifications followed by a sequence of missile landing locations. <br><br>A kingdom is specified by a number N ( 3≤N≤10) on a single line which indicates the number of sites in this kingdom. The next line contains the x and y coordinates of the power station, followed by N-1 lines of x, y pairs indicating the locations of homes served by this power station. A value of -1 for N indicates that there are no more kingdoms. There will be at least one kingdom in the data set. <br><br>Following the last kingdom specification will be the coordinates of one or more missile attacks, indicating the location of a missile landing. Each missile location is on a line by itself. You are to process missile attacks until you reach the end of the file. <br><br>Locations are specified in kilometers using coordinates on a 500 km by 500 km grid. All coordinates will be integers between 0 and 500 inclusive. Coordinates are specified as a pair of integers separated by white-space on a single line. The input file will consist of up to 20 kingdoms, followed by any number of missile attacks. <br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">The output consists of a single number representing the total area of all kingdoms without electricity after all missile attacks have been processed.

You may or may not find the following formula useful. 
Given a polygon described by the vertices v0,v1..vn such that v0=vn 
the signed area of the polygon is given by 
<img src=./data/images/1616-1.gif'>
where the x, y coordinates of vi=(xi,yi) ; 
the edges of the polygon are from  v(i) to v(i+1)  for i=0..n-1 . 
If the points describing the polygon are given in a counterclockwise direction, 
the value of a will be positive, 
and if the points of the polygon are listed in a clockwise direction, 
the value of a will be negative. </div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">数据范围与提示</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"> <a href="/search.php?field=problem&key=UVA&source=1&searchmode=source"> UVA </a> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ui vertical footer segment"><div class="ui center aligned container"><span style="color: #999;">OI-offline-problem-reader Powered by <a href="http://www.sycstudio.com">SYCstudio</a>.</span></div></div></div></body></html>
