He does not regret for the loss of the files themselves, but for the very nice and convenient directory structure that he had created and cherished during years of work. Fortunately, Bill has several copies of directory listings from his hard drive. Using those listings he was able to recover full paths (like &quot;WINNT\SYSTEM32\CERTSRV\CERTCO~1\X86&quot;) for some directories. He put all of them in a file by writing each path he has found on a separate line. Your task is to write a program that will help Bill to restore his state of the art directory structure by providing nicely formatted directory tree. </div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">This problem contains multiple test cases!<br><br>The first line of a multiple input is an integer N, then a blank line followed by N input blocks.

Each directory name shall be listed on its own line preceded by a number of spaces that indicate its depth in the directory hierarchy. The subdirectories shall be listed in lexicographic order immediately after their parent directories preceded by one more space than their parent directory. Top level directories shall have no spaces printed before their names and shall be listed in lexicographic order. See sample below for clarification of the output format.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1
