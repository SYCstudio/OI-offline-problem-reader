And the game is called “Yehr Game” because of the inventer.<br>Yehr Game is a board game involving two players. It is played on a board with 40 squares arranged in an ten-by-four grid. At the beginning of the game each player controls four pieces: one acm, one bahamas, one cab and one daze. If one player has no pieces to move, he lost the game.<br>Setup:<br>Yehr Game is played on a rectangle board of ten rows and four columns. The pieces are divided, by convention, into red and black sets. The players are referred to as &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Black&quot;, and each begins the game with four pieces of the specified color. These consist of one acm, one bahamas, one cab and one daze.<br><br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/3649-1.jpg></center> <br><br>Movement:<br>First, they setup their pieces on the board.<br>(1)  the piece red acm can be placed on A1~,A2,A3,A4,A5;the piece black acm A6~A10;<br>(2)  the piece red bahamas can place on B1~B5; the piece black Bahamas B6~B10;<br>(3)  the piece red cab can place on C1~C5; the piece black cab C6~C10;<br>(4)  the piece red daze cab can place on D1~D5; the piece black daze D6~D10;<br>Second, they determine who moves first by dice. After the initial move, the players alternately move one piece at a time.<br>Each chess piece has its own style of moving.<br>(1)  Acm can only move one direction: red from left to right; black from right to left. Acm can only move to the next square. If one player’s acm moves to a square with the opponent acm, he win the game.<br>(2)  Bahamas and cab can move two direction: from left to right or from right to left.
