It said: <br>Once upon a time, when Zheng He was sailing along the Malaysia coast, a strange volcano suddenly erupted.The volcano threw some strange hot rocks on the sea. Those rocks floated on the water at first, and after some time, when water went into their center, they would explode. Every rock could be considered as a point and it had a set of properties X, Y, R, T and L, meaning that:<br>The position of the rock was (X, Y). The rock would explode at time T, and the explosion would last until time T+L. During the time interval [T, T+L](both ends are included), any ship whose distance from that rock was no more than R would be destroyed.<br>At time 0, Zheng He's ship was at the position (0, 0), and his ship could also be considered as a point. When talking about &quot;distance&quot;, it means the Manhattan Distance. In a plane, the Manhattan Distance between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. Zheng He's ship could only move horizontally or vertically. The maximum speed of Zheng He's ship was 1 per second. That means, if Zheng He's ship was at (x, y) now, then 1 second latter it may arrive at any point in the region S( S={(x1,y1) | |x1-x|+|y1-y| &lt;= 1}).<br>Suppose Zheng He knew every rock's properties. Given time P, Zheng He wanted to know whether he could survive after time P.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Input contains several test cases.
