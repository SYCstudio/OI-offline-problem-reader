Yuanfang, What Do You Think?</h1></div><div class="row" style="margin-top: -15px"><span class="ui label">内存限制：2000/1000 MS (Java/Others)</span> <span class="ui label">时间限制：32768/32768 K (Java/Others)</span></div></div></br><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">题目描述</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">      Factoring a polynomial is always a hard and important issue in mathematics teaching in middle schools. Teacher Liu loves teaching this issue very much, but his students are not good at it.<br>     Yuanfang is the best student in Teacher Liu's class. Every time when Teacher Liu comes up with a hard problem and it seems no student can solve it, Liu always says: &quot;Yuanfang , what do you think?&quot;。<br>     This week, Teacher Liu began to teach how to factor a polynomial. On Monday, Teacher Liu said : &quot;Let's factor x<sup>2</sup>-1 ... Yuanfang, what do you think?&quot;<br>     On Tuesday, Teacher Liu said : &quot;Let's factor x<sup>3</sup>-1 ... Yuanfang, what do you think?&quot;<br>     On Wednesday, Teacher Liu said : &quot;Let's factor x<sup>4</sup>-1 ... Yuanfang, what do you think?&quot;<br>     …..<br>     On Friday, Yuanfang got crazy. She wanted to solve this problem permanently. So she came to you, the only programmer she knows, for help.<br>     You should write a program to factor the polynomial x<sup>n</sup>-1. In other words, represent the polynomial x<sup>n</sup>-1 by a product of irreducible polynomials in which coefficients are all integers.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">      There are several test cases. Every case is an integer n in a line (n≤1100) meaning that you should factor the polynomial x<sup>n</sup>-1.<br>      Input ends with n=0.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输出格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">      We print polynomials like this:<br>      1.x<sup>2</sup> to x^2;<br>      2.x<sup>3</sup>-1 to x^3-1;<br>      3.x<sup>6</sup>-2x<sup>4</sup>+1 to x^6-2x^4+1.<br>      For each test case, you should print the result polynomials in a certain order. To sort the polynomials, we compare the coefficients of them from high-degree to low-degree. The coefficient with a smaller absolute value has a smaller order. When absolute values are the same, negative coefficient has a smaller order. Please print the result polynomials from small order to large order.<br>      In the result, put every factor polynomial between a pair of parentheses(Except that the result is just x-1 as shown in sample). Every factor polynomial must satisfy the following conditions:<br>      1.It can't be factored any more.<br>      2.All the terms of the same degree must be combined.<br>      3.No term's coefficient is 0.<br>      4.The terms appear in the descending order by degree.<br>      5.All coefficients are integers.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">样例</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><h4>样例输入</h4><div class="ui existing segment"><pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;"><code class="lang-plain">1
