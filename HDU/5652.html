With that at first the communation started to reduce and eventually died.<br><br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/C681-1003-2.jpg></center> <br><br>Let's assume from my crude drawing that the only way to reaching from India to China or viceversa is through that grid, blue portion is the ocean and people haven't yet invented the ship. and the yellow portion is desert and has ghosts roaming around so people can't travel that way. and the black portions are the location which have mountains and white portions are plateau which are suitable for travelling. moutains are very big to get to the top, height of these mountains is infinite. So if there is mountain between two white portions you can't travel by climbing the mountain.<br>And at each step people can go to 4 adjacent positions.<br><br>Our archeologists have taken sample of each mountain and estimated at which point they rise up at that place. So given the times at which each mountains rised up you have to tell at which time the communication between India and China got completely cut off.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">There are multi test cases. the first line is a sinle integer $T$ which represents the number of test cases.<br><br>For each test case, the first line contains two space seperated integers $N, M$. next $N$ lines consists of strings composed of $0, 1$ characters. $1$ denoting that there's already a mountain at that place, $0$ denoting the plateau. on $N + 2$ line there will be an integer $Q$ denoting the number of mountains that rised up in the order of times.
