While the clock may state that it is, say, thirty minutes<br>until liftoff for a rocket or shuttle, there are built-in holds where the clock is stopped for a set amount of time. For example, there may be a 15-minute<br>hold when the countdown reaches the 8-minute mark. The end result is that more time passes from the beginning of the countdown to the end than<br>the numbers on the clock would imply.<br><br>LAI-BACH uses a simple &quot;command file&quot; format to manage holds for their countdowns on their computer systems. All commands start with a<br>positive integer no greater than 1440 (countdowns longer than a day make Doctor Doom angry), followed by a directive. The format of the<br>commands is as follows:<br><br><center><img style='max-width:100%;' src=./data/images/c131-1009-1.jpg></center><br><br>All conditions are represented by short strings of lowercase letters, no more than 20 characters long; their actual values are not provided in the<br>command structure, as they are determined by actual conditions during the launch (whether the fuel tanks have been topped off, whether the<br>Fantastic Four is currently fighting Doctor Doom, and so on), but they are always either true or false and do not change during the course of a single<br>countdown. A hold time n is a positive integer no more than 60 (minutes), as long delays also irritate Victor.<br><br>Given a particular command file, you are to determine both the shortest possible time and the longest possible time that the countdown can run. The<br>commands may be present in any order, but there will always be one and only one START directive; there will be precisely as much whitespace on<br>each line as dictated by the format given above. No two commands in a command file will reference the same minute t.</div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column"><h4 class="ui top attached block header">输入格式</h4><div class="ui bottom attached segment font-content"><div style="position: relative; overflow: hidden;">Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) indicating the number of data sets.
